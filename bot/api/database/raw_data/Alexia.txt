One day you came and made me blue
Nobody close to me just you
You have the power in your eyes
Me and you
Today you left me far behind
How could I live without you tell me now
Forever waiting for your love

Me and you
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
You got the sun let it shine on me
Can't get away don't forget my tears
This is the way I feel good
Give me a reason to come back to you
Fire's still burning inside of me
Feels so long with my shattered dream
I try so hard stronger than free
Why don't you want to recall what could be

Me and you
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lost and afraid you're a light for me
Open my heart wash away my fears
If I'm scared you'll take me to
A brighter place where I can run to you
If you could only believe in me
There's nothing else to do can't you see
If you feel the way I live for two
We could be in heaven and our dream will come true

Me and you
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala

One day you came and made me blue
Nobody close to me just you
You have the power in your eyes

Music is the key to fall in love
Music is the answer of the world
Music is the power to survive when I feel down
Even if I'm wasting all my time
Trying to get your face out of my mind
The summer takes you back into my heart, into my soul
Remember the time when we were spending afternoons
Making love we used to fly on the sun
Recall the days we broke the rules we jumped the wall
You know that i would never lose your love
I'm feeling like a dandy around the world
Open my heart and keep on trying to find your love
I, I can see this passion drift apart
I thought that I would never miss your love
The summer is crazy ah ha
La la la la
The summer is crazy ah ha
La la la la
The summer is crazy tonight x3
La la la la
I keep on thinking how you did me wrong
My love was true and I will never let it go
I need to find a way to save my heart
'Cause I know that I will never have your love
The summer is crazy...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Come fai
A tornare qui
Senza bussare
Dimmi come fai
Per niente facile
Vivere cosi!
Ti dovrei odiare
Ma come potrei?
Dimmi come posso fare
Per salvare il mio cuore
Tu non sai cos'è il rispetto
Se non senti il dolore
Sei tu
Chiami quando vuoi
Dici vengo e non lo fai
Dì un po'
Non si fa così
È un pezzo che aspetto qui
Ah non mi controllo più
Mi affanni mi inganni tu
E adesso corri!
C'è qualcosa che ho da dire!
Vuoi forse metterti nei guai?
Io non riderei!
Dimmi di me che cosa ne vuoi fare!
Dimmi come posso fare
Per salvare il mio cuore
E no! E dimmi dimmi, dimmi amore!
Tu non sai cos'è il rispetto
Se non senti il dolore
Dimmi che, dimmi se
Sei tu
Vieni quando vuoi
Nel mio letto e poi
Contatto!
Febbre sale su
Mi incanti e mi butti giù
No!
Io non ti voglio qui
Ma non posso perderti
E non mi chiedere
Di smettere di urlare!
T'ammazzerei ma poi non so?!?
Quando non ci sei ...
Senza di te
Non c'è più il sole
Dimmi cosa posso fare
Per salvare il mio cuore
Cosa sei, cosa sei per me baby!
Tu non sai cos'è il rispetto
Se non senti il dolore
Non è non è, non è così che devi fare
Dimmi come posso fare
Per salvare il mio cuore
Ma non mi vedi, cosa altro puoi desiderare!
Tu non sai cos'è il rispetto
Se non senti il dolore
Mi devi rispettare, l'amore prende e dà!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I'm hanging on to you to letting go my pain
I'm begging you to stay ?cause I'm hungry of your love
Waiting for so long with my head between my hands
I felt as touched the ground every time you treat me bad

Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye
Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye

I wonder to myself, if I were free to leave
'Cause you did that to me a thousand times and back again
I was always there for you and ready to forgive
But your heart is made of steel, keep on turning me around

Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye
Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye

'Cause you're my lovely and I live for you
The way you smile, the way you are, I wanna hold you by my side
The way you touch me, the way you groove me
The way you smile, the way you are, I wanna hold you by my side
Oh, oh, I'm hanging on, oh yeah
I keep on hanging on to you, baby

Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye
Because I miss you, I miss you, baby
Because I miss you every time you say goodbye

'Cause you're my lovely and I live for you
The way you smile, the way you are, I wanna hold you by my side

Uh ah ah
Baby baby baby
Uh ah ah
Baby baby baby
Every time I see you close the door
I wish I could believe that you would never lie
As I see you walking down the street tonight
I ain't so sure that you'll be back again this time
(aah) Every time that you are by my side
Deep inside I know you'll never be my guy
(aah) Yet I think you've never really been in love
Baby won't you tell me now the reason why
(aah) But I can't forgive your eyes
Memories will never die
Baby baby baby (ooh) don't you want me
Don't you need me (aah) by your side (baby baby baby)
Baby baby baby (ooh) don't you want me
Won't you hold me (aah) one more night (baby baby baby)
Every time I see you've got the blues
There's a reason to be always by your side
But when I feel that you can tell me only lies
There's no chance for me to keep you satisfied
(aah) If you look into my soul
(aah) You could see a perfect world
(aah) But I can't forget your eyes
Memories will never die
Baby baby baby (ooh)
Oh baby (aah)
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)
Don't you want me (ooh)
Don't you need me (ah)

Friday night, I've got to find a way
I need somebody to take this blues away
I've got to call my friends
We need to have some fun
We gonna have a party, we just wanna dance...
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
Hey you! You've got to come my friend
We have got all friday night to spend
Come on, we've got to make a plan
Gotta a thing running through my head
I - I wanna lose control
Big time's gonna take my soul
Hey - we gotta move and groove and fall into the party
There's nothing else that I can do
When music starts, on friday night
I go insane my baby
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
If you , you wanna find a man
You better try to understand
Hey baby, you gotta free your soul
When you dance you can see your goal
Hey why don't you look at me?
This is how you need to be
Yeah,I know the way to take
Your heart moving my body!
It's just the way to have some fun
Never break my heart
It's friday night, I'm going crazy!
Don't you know this is no party
If you're not shaking your body
Don't you know that it's no fun
If you don't love anybody
Don't you know this is no party

I'M WALKING UNDER THE RAINFALL
I'M READY TO GET OUT OF MY FENCE
I NEED A SHIFT NOT A SHELTER
THIS ROOM IS ALWAYS EMPTY
I KNOW WHAT I NEED
I KEEP ON DREAMING
I LOOK AROUND MYSELF
I'M TRYING TO SEE MY LIFE
AND I KEEP ON DREAMING
SEARCHING FOR A BRIGHTER LIGHT
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR MY BABY ALL DAY
I'M LOOKING FOR MY BABY OH YEAH
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR MY BABY ALL DAY
I'M LOOKING FOR MY BABY
I'VE NEVER EVER HAD ENOUGH
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR MY BABY
I'M FALLING DOWN IN A FABLE
MY MIND IS GONE AND I'M FLYING AWAY
I'M SITTING OVER THE RAINBOW
MY PAST IS FINALLY BROKEN
I FEEL SO COMPLETE
I KEEP ON DREAMING
I LOOK AROUND MYSELF
I'M TRYING TO SEE MY LIFE
AND I KEEP ON DREAMING
SEARCHING FOR A BRIGHTER LIGHT

I want your money, honey
I don't want you body
Baby I don't need your love 2x
I want your money, honey
I don't want your body
Baby I don't need your love
'cause my heart is made of steal
I want your money, honey
Idon't want your body
Baby I don't need your love
'cause I don't believe in love
Love is a memory that I keep on hiding deep in my soul
And every time I try to set my heart I loose myself so bad
Life is a mystery no one knows the secrets to break through
And everytime I try to change my ways, I find myself alone
I don't know what to do
All day I'm sad and blue
I'll never be that fool
I want your money honey
Idon't want your body
Baby I don't need your love
'cause my heart is made of steal
I want your money honey
I don't want your body
Baby I don't need your love
'cause I don't believe in love
I live in misery
I don't want to fight for love anymore
And every time I think of yesterday
I see how it was wrong
I know my destiny
I don' t want to shed my tears anymore
And every time I think of all my prayers
I know that I am strong !
I don't know what to do
All day I'm sad and blue
I'll never be that fool
I want your money honey
Idon't want your body
Baby I don't need your love !

With or without you baby
With or without you
I want you
With or without your love
Te amo
With or without love
I need you baby
I've got something in my soul
I don't want to let it go
I just want to let you know
But it's hard for me to show
This is something new for me
But it's where I wanna be
It's another kind of world
'Cause I know that I'm in love
Uuuuh (I want to be where I'm in love)
Mmm mmh (I want to be where I'm in love)
Now you don't know what to do
But you want to tell the truth
Someone else belongs to you
And you feel the same way too
She's a beauty more than me
Maybe is older I can see
I don't think she's good for you
She can't love you like I do
I think I'm losing my mind
Aah (I want to be where I'm in love)
Oh baby (I want to be where I'm in love)
It's so sad to stay at home
Sitting by the telephone
Waiting hours for your call
Kick and fight against the wall
It's so cold inside of me
I'm so blind that I can't see
That you want my love for free
Is not the way it's gonna be
I think I'm losing my mind
With or without you baby
With or without you
I want you
With or without your love
Te amo
With or without love
I hate you baby !EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Siamo stati complici
Siamo stati unici
Ora esisto e tu qui non ci sei
Avevi solo regole
Io forse troppe favole
A questo mondo non ci sono eroi
Aaah, se il tempo si fermasse adesso
Aaah
Solo un attimo e poi
Per non perderci mai
Ingannevole
Fermo Immagine
La costante eri tu
Non serviva di più
Era fragile, fermo immagine
Uooh uooh uooh
Era un fragile fermo immagine
Costellazioni limpide
Per conclusioni scomode
La casa adesso è piccola per noi
I cuori si travestono
Le scuse ormai non bastano
E quel che è stato ormai non torna mai
Aaah, se il tempo si fermasse adesso
Aaah
Solo un attimo e poi
Per non perderci noi
Ingannevole
Fermo Immagine
La costante ero io
Ora è solo un addio
Dentro un fragile
Fermo immagine
Uooh uooh uooh
Dentro un fragile
Fermo immagine
C'è confusione
Poco oltre il confine
C'è la paura
Della libertà
Ora che
Io e te, non c'è
Non c'è, non c'è
La costante ero io
Ora è solo un addio
Dentro un fragile fermo immagine
Uooh ooh ooh
Dentro un fragile fermo immagineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Whenever you want me baby
I'll bring you the sun
Whenever you need me darling
I'll shine in the dark
If you only could understand
Whatelse do you want me to do
If only you could see the reasons why
I wanted to come back to you
How many times
Do I have to cry all along the way
How many lies
Do I have to bear to be yours again
Whenever you want me baby
I'll bring you the sun
Wheneever you need me darling
I'll shine in the dark
If only we could turn the pages
Forget how we've wasted our time
If only we could say the things we've never said
There's no higher mountain to climb
How many times
