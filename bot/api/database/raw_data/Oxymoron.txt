Just another day, and just another mess
But if you resign you'll never know success
Chin up, get out now and try again my friend
This life is your last, so enjoy it 'til the end

You stand in the heap of the ruins that your life used to be
All the time you succumbed to a fake or a dangerous mistake
You stand in the heap of the rubble of broken ideals
It's true that life's a bitch
REsign to your fate, life's hard but I live to win
...Life's a bitch
Just keep on trying over and over again
...Life's a bitch
Risk it - standing proud demands to give a bit
No future to behold, so make the best of it
Face it, find out that it's worth to make a stand
Nothing venture nothing have - it's true my friend
 
There's fuckers everywhere
It's them who make me sneer
I got no money so I went begging
They told me to go away
'cause lazy dogs like me should all be gased, was all they said
But once when I was out looking for a job, they eyed me mockingly
I was not the one they were out for the guy excused
Sent home again
In the streets you meet them everyday
You need your own defense
But people still are worrying
Why I sneer, they'll never understand
At school and work they pulled you down with fucked up politics
The same bunch constitutes out government, i hope they'll pay
 
You know my mind is twisted i'm struggling for control
A discrepant identity but fused into a whole
An hour one half takes hold of me the other it is gone
And suddenly i'm turning crazed i'm an incalculable man
Wrong or right?
Black or white?

You see..
I lost my identity
I'm getting schizophrenic
I lost my identity
Two voices ride me over but both are part of me
I dance in daydreams on the verge of my insanity
Inside i'm getting nervous around me i cast a glance
And have to watch my limbs behave as the dominant one wants
Strong or weak?
Sane or sick?
My changeable behavior withdraws from my control
A discrepant identity but fused into a whole
I'm running round in circles i'm trapped within my mind
Each time it rises in my gut i try to oppress it but i can't
 
There's too much pressure
Breaking down on me
But I'm fed up
Full of disdain
Law and Order
Just an empty phrase
I'm antisocial
Cause I have it my own way
No survival
If you ignore their dictates
I've got no idol
And my god is me
All this mess-up
Has blown my fuse
So call me a rebel
Or a living abuse
I'm Anti - fashion
Anti - religion
Anti - police
And Anti - system
Anti - commercial
Anti - prison
Anti -Anti-everything
I'm Anti - fashion
Anti - religion
Anti - police
And Anti - system
Anti anti everything okay

Down in the town in the stinky clubs
I'm pissed near a collapse, but I won't stop
My hair is died, I'm a complete flop
But I can't take it, man!
I was raised as a son who should get on
But what has become of me, their son?
I'm Oi-possessed and like my way
What has become of me?

I wanna be a dirty punk!
Studs & chains and leather braces
You wanna be a dirty punk!
Do live fast and sod their phrases
- Dirty Punk!
Now heading for the welfare
Run down is what you say
Just watch me when I run amok, and try to
Hide from me
I never really cared 'bout what they thought
I won't give in 'til I peg out. 'cause I
Won't end up like my dad, it's sheer conformity
Down in the town in the stinky clubs
I'm pissed near a collapse, but I won't stop
My hair is died, I'm a complete flop
But I can't take it, man!
Was raised as a son who should get on
But I rather do it on my own
I'm Oi-possessed and won't conform
What has become of me?
 
Daily other places and we're still going on
Plenty of new faces cos the nights are long
Tearing down the highway, full speed ahead
Miles uncounted, the van? become our bed
...I really missed all that
All bottles empty so we gotta stop
Hey what a country we're not sold a drop
Heading for the venue for another kill
Out and up now because we're on the bill
...and play we will

Chaos across the nation - we HIT THE ROAD again
Chaos and fun and booze for free that's how life's to be
Chaos across the nation let's go to HIT THE ROAD again
(...up the next decade)
Living like a rover, troubles where we get
Getting pulled over - oh, how we're used to that
One room at a motel for the six of us
The rest too short cos our next show's away some hours
...and we stuck in bars
 
There's violence coming up, trouble on the streets
Gangs are taking over, but where will this lead?
Do you care for their frustration, no you don't!
The kids have no relation to your mode

The same like back in '76
Bored and full of violence
Can't you see in fact what's going on
It started off in '77
When the kids got up together
Discipline gets nowhere but to hatred
Yellow press rack their brains over who's to blame
Ain't the message obvious, what do you mean?
Or is all the increasing outrage just a joke?
But how come your prisons are packed, ain't this odd?
There's writings on the wall and broken panes
The youth don't put up with your silly games
Do you care for their frustrations, no you don't!
The kids have no relation to your mode
 
I know all your moods and faces
You try a gaze that paralyses
Stand back from nobody and none
And drop your panties for a number one
You stick at nothing with the things you're running for
But don't tread on those who've served your scheme once more

You're a bore, you whore
Let down friends are not to mention
You pretend to relieve your tension
I know that you can't love anyone
But you say you get the bloke you want
You feign like no other when you're out to reach a goal
You give what you get, but nothing's free at all
I know all your moods and faces
You try a gaze that paralyses
You say you get the bloke you want
But I know you're a sleazy cunt
But that's the way you are...
 
They say it's time to crack down on what they call obscene
But what they meant is blokes like me and the life I chose to lead
OK let's have an uproar, their troops are marching in
With determination in their eyes they've rallied all again

Come on, come on
Give me a Petrol Bomb
The riot troops assembly is finally marching off
A few had luck and could escape the baton-slinging lot
Some fellows are arrested, perhaps they're locked away
You lift your bottle and set out to have your fun again
Pronouncement of the judgement, the youth is led away
He wasn't even sixteen and had smashed an offie's pane
Put in reformatories where other wankers wait
Who try to force him in their frame - break out before it's too late
Come on, come on
Give him a Petrol Bomb
Now you speak out against the youth's aggressions
Scream and shout, but you taught them how to hate
Now you speak out but the account is settled
Praise your luck there ain't bullets through your head
 
In the tube a gang in black
Purple stubble and tiger strap
They make a stink, some get freaked out
By the volume of the mohican sound
Mohican tunes, play the fuckin' mohican tunes!
And down the tunnel in a crew, a girl is dancing to mohican tunes
And at the gig the air is tense, cause mohican tunes blow up their brains
And down the tunnel in a crew, a girl is dancing to mohican tunes
And at the gig the air is tense, a sheer fit hits the audience
Switch it on and play it loud, listen to the wildest sound
A filthy mob hangs 'round the place. Filth and leather, pins and chains
 
Now it磗 time to pull you in
You磖e annoying me and cause some bad emotions
Your whole life磗 a sin
You磖e a reason why I justify abortion
No guts, no pride
Only slander of a miserable mind
Your gossip makes you a git
And I see what磗 at the bottom of it
Deride me, backbite me
Mister Twister, do you have fun in that ?
But finally I磛e had enough

Cunt ?DON碩 CALL ME CUNT
You fucker, you don磘 call me a cunt
Oh-oh - you make a mistake, mister, if you call me that
Oh-oh - you can call me sucker but don磘 call me a cunt
Stop prying into things and affairs
Of which you got no slightest notion
What drives your intrigues -
Is it jealousy or just a pile of bullshit ?
It磗 an advice you get
It would be better if you don磘 call me that
My tale means nothing to you
You never got there磗 a double-edged truth
You fault me, insult me
Mister Twister, you better hold your tongue now
Take care what you call me
You can call me sucker but don磘 call me a cunt
Oh-oh - you make a mistake, mister, if you call me that
Oh-oh - Mister Twister I disgust you
Now it磗 time I made clear
You磖e annoying me and cause some bad emotions
I can磘 abide your jeer
You磖e a reason why I justify abortion
Shut up, rein in
You磖e the kind of bloke who needs some beating
Keep going and I see red
You don磘 know me but you磖e spreading all shit
You磖e warned now, beware now
So listen Mister Twister you磖e better fucking off now
Stay out of this, you know damn all
You fault me, insult me
Mister Twister, you better watch your back now
To say this is all I want:
You can call me sucker but don磘 call me a cunt
 
It's the same old game, but you can't keep up
You mouth is gonna cry, but they wanna keep it shut
What do you expect in this break down age?
Spit out mate and give vent to your rage
The course you're trying is a vacant lot
One day soon you'll end up with a shot
As a member of the dead-end youth
You're sick of the games they're gonna play on you

Dead end generation - oh wake up
You're just another faction - oh wake up
Dead end generation - oh wake up
Sick of the situation - oh wake up
The scene is set for a marching up
There's no way back and forward is a concrete gap
You won't get out if you smash your head against the wall
So stand your ground and you ain't gonna fall
Don't let them kick in your head, or grind you down
Spit out, give vent to your rage, and trust nobody
 
A glaring plague warned of peril
The city's lying in exhalation
All people killed by dioxine
Radioactive contamination, poisonous crap wherever you glance
You can't afford to be affected, poisonous crap inside of their heads
Drives 'em into fucked up actions

Poison all yourselves you body
Beware, beware, there's poison in the air
Beware, beware, it's gonna be a state affair
Beware, beware, there's poison everywhere
Beware, beware, beware, poisonous outside
A punky band is prodding uproar
Beware of their poisonous slogans
They spill their hatred, just look out there
The youth gets spoiled by vandalism
Every page another lie
It's propaganda and deception
To poison- poison-poison your brain
And let them keep on pulling the strings
 
Bluelight screaming, figures in the dark
Shelter-seeking, but you've run so far
They gonna get out if you're slow and put you in a cell
You don't wanna be arrested so you run like hell
Here comes the pigs
They always nick the underdogs
There's no regret but nowhere to go
Draw back, breathing, but you've run to slow
They don't care if you're innocent, they don't care if you're right
They're looking for a scapegoat and they found their prey
Hide or you're getting screwed
 
Suddenly the things ain't what they used to be
Now everything's changed and I wonder why
Too scared to face the possibilities
My life's so different I wanna close my eyes
Can't get rid of the growing fear inside me
Denying it all is just the real insanity

I try to run, I try to flee
...but you can't run from reality
I try to run, to run away
...no use to call 999
It's been my self-protection but now I've got the prove
So far I've been to blind to accept the fucking truth
Well now I've come to see which way the cat jumps
And that's the reason why it's getting out of hand
Can't get it out, this growing fear inside me
Denying it all is just sheer insecurity
Suddenly hte things ain't what they used to be
The lie I've been living is catching up with me
Yeah I quit my job cos I wanna be free
But what a living do I get without a pay
...no way
Repressed them all, these bothering things that annoyed me
It ain't nothing new to turn your back on reality
 
In the shadow of the concrete giants
Got to live there from day to day
Grey cold houses have been there for too long
Hear the voices of the kids'sad song

In our city grows a bomb
In this wasteland they've bred a new age
Crammed together like rats in a cage
They've built a time bomb that is running fast
Use their fucking coencrete to plug up their arses
It's the place where you're at home
Have grown and where you roam
Hell, how you hate this town
- this Concrete jungle
Got nowhere else to go
Looks like this anyhow
Has transformed in a ghetto
- this concrete jungle
The streets look desolate
And decay has set in there yet
Oh what a dreary sight
- this concrete jungle
Their dreams of progress
But the empty shells remained
Where the now lodge our kind
- this concrete jungle
It's a wastland of our days
Where crime and aggro rise
That's a fact they face
- this concrete jungle
 
Take'em all and take the piss
It's time for a new riot
Scream it at the nation
That we ain't gone so far

We're the best cause we're the ones
If s not the class that you are from
Yes, all minorities get oppress
But we're the ones so fuck the rest
... I don't think I will conform
Twenty years of struggle
Left fragments on the floor
But we're the generation
To pick'em up once more
 
Shadowlike they haunt me at night
Horrible dreams to grab my sleep
Whatever I do, wherever I go
They're always near beside
If these turn up there ain't no joy
All I can's detroy
If these turn up there ain't no joy
Nothing works to scare 'em away

Black cats, black cats
Always scary, how do I lose em'
Black cats,black cats
An evil omen - Black cats
Stumbling through the streets at night
I was overcome again by this bothersome plague
It didn't come off it's over now
This was the final show
If these turn up there ain't no joy
All I can's detroy
If these turn up there ain't no joy
Nothing works to scare 'em away
 
What's the matter?
Could it be that you wanna prove you're keen
And a man who's man enough to fight?
I'm not sorry for your lot
It's your job if you get shot
But you tell me that you not afraid
What does a hero feel about
When the rest of his fellows is lying on the ground?

Hurry up - Get a Gun today
Hurry up - meet your destiny
Hurry up - Get a gun today
Join them on their raid
Is your cause worth fighting for?
Or a country worth a war?
Hurry up and join the force tonight
What's the matter?
Could it be that you wanna prove you're keen
And a man who's mad about his pride?
 
Living in a shell had never been a thing for me
Safe in private places you just ponder what's to be
I'm in need of action but you rather fade away
Living in your own world where you keep to things you can take

You slogged all day and get your pay
And lock yourself away
Are you sure You're living?
Just going through the motions
Ordered life and slaving
I'm fed up with this bullshit
Are you sure you're living?
Headlong into my fate
I'm better off without it
And live on straight ahead
All the time you're abusing those you claim who go astray
Still don't dare to break out of the boring life you lead
