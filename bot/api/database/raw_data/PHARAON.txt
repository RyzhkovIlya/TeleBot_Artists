(verse)
All we need is love
This is for the girl in the dress, oh yes
Maybe I just found the one
I ain't tryna be a preacher
But they don't know how to treat ya, my love
I know you think about us
I'm sorry for that drama last June
Or that track that I released
I had just lost you, and that song brought peace
My needs, I need to get your attention
Welcome to the world will be playing in a second
Your love is like a drive in a all black Lexus
Aura so bright I nearly missed my exit
We might find a new dimension
I ain't tryna rush ya lets elope at the Kremlin
I know you got caught up in a daze, in the days
You were trying to run away, but okay
Let me run away with ya, be my go getter
Off into the picture, I'll run with her
(chorus)
I ain't never seen no angel flying astray
Pardon me, but only in dreams do we feel this way
Marry me a cigarette, high at a red light in the race
I can't feel your heart, the morphine played its ace
