Tearing up my history for you

You the, you the, you the, you the top one
So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem
Can I get some of your love?

Been around the money, been around some names
But the chico's still the same, some things never change
Here's a tip, show me your friends
I'll show you your future, keep the change
I've seen 'em come and go, I've seen 'em sell they souls
You my number one draft pick, baby, let's pick and roll

They looking for the perfect life

But there ain't nothing perfect, girl
No such thing as a perfect world
These broads try hard to be
Who they not and not who they are
Baby, you sweating what? Baby, you sweating who?
You talking 'bout such and such who tries to be you?
Man, you JFK, mami, you out your mind
Misery loves company, I'll tell you one more time

Le voy a hacer la historia a Pitbull y a Sensato pa' que la conozcan
Yuli la mesa está servida, la sopa está caliente
No hay ni pa' azorar las moscas

Míster todo el mundo
(El Taxi)
Sensato del patio
(Osmani Garcia)
Queremos darle una bienvenida
A todas las mujeres que hacen vino
Por todo el mundo

Yo la conocí en un taxi, en camino al club
Yo la conocí en un taxi, en camino al club

El taxi

Lo paró con una mano, lo paro que yo la vi
Cho, cho, chofer pare el taxi
Cho, cho, cho, cho, chofer para el taxi
Ella está pa' un accidente, no me importa si está crazy
No me importa si hace vino por ahí
Cho, cho, chofer pare el taxi
Cho, cho, cho, cho, chofer para el taxi
No me importa si es casada
No la quiero pa' instalarme
Yo no quiero que sea sólo para mí
Cho, cho, chofer pare el taxi

Ella hace de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Ella sabe de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Ella hace de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Ella sabe de todo, to, to, to, to, to

En el taxi, la conocí caminando por un backstreet
Estaba sexy, pero tan sexy
Que por poquito arrollamos un tipo y chocamos el taxi
Era el chofer
El que dijo "Oye, mira esa mujer"
Está dura, dura, qué dura
Pero ya tú sabes que ella quiere efectivo dinero, visa qué chula
Lula
Con culo de mula
Y no le tengas duda, ella le saca todo el jugo a la uva
¿Que hace vino? Sí, hace vino
Yo la conocí en un taxi, en camino al club

Ella hace de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Ella sabe de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Yo la conocí, en un taxi yo la conocí
Le dije, ''¿tú tienes novio?'', ella dijo que sí
¿Cómo así? ¿Entonces qué tú haces por aquí?
Tú me lo paraste, el taxi, siéntate aquí
Can I get a kissy? Can I get a hickey?
You look like a freaky dame cerebro y pinky
Tú dedo miñiqui, te pones kinky
You put it in places that I would never think it (right)
Ella se bebe dos botellas de vino
Para que se vea más fino y sea bueno pa' los intestinos
Pero no, a ella lo que le gustan son los masculinos
Para ella hacerle vino (¿qué?)
Que ella hace vino

Ella hace todo, de todo, de todo, de todo
Ella hace todo, de todo, de todo, de todo
Dayamí la Musa
Ella hace de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Ella sabe de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Ella hace de todo, to, to, to, to, to
Ella sabe de todo, to, to, to, to, to

With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture
Bury a boarder, record-breaker, won't cha
Give credit where credit is due, don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black, I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one
Let's, excuse me, baby
Go, yeah, you, baby
Back, oh you groovy, baby
In, let's make a movie, baby
Time, excuse me, baby
Let's, yeah you, baby
Go, oh you groovy, baby
Back in, let's make a movie, baby
Time

Baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
You're the...
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road
Where niggas go to see naked hoes
Shake that shit bitch
And be off in the club with a hard ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit
Put a hump in your back
And lick it raw
To a 3 point stance
But you mess up yo ass
You must be on that kanye work out plan
Like head shoulder knees hoes

Mr. Worldwide – I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade

Mouth signed check, ass can’t cash
One-time Lebron boss, D-Wade flash
I can’t forget that boy UD, Udonis Has
I’m from Miami Dade County, born and raised there
Mouth full of golds and diamonds, but talk is cheap
There’s rules and codes, in Dade Country streets
Y’all break rules and codes to talk shit on beats
No te equivoques mi hijito, Miami’ll bring the heat

I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
Welcome to Dade County…
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County

Here's a deposition, watch what you speak
Who’s the definition of Miami? Me
I move cultures, don’t believe me – watch and see
Ask Barack Obama, he’ll bet the White House on me
You got money, yeah – yeah, that’s sweet
But we all know Baby and Slim really eat
You talk Miami, if you talkin’ heat
Moral of the story: don’t shit where you eat

I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
Welcome to Dade County…
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County

I had to do this for my city dog
It’s something that I love so deeply
I don’t wanna be 305 Miami Dade County
I am 305 Miami Dade County
I bleed 305 Miami Dade County
So when we show love to those
That get their city destroyed by a hurricane
And then they come down here
Y faltan al respeto
Hazme el favor y para de comer tanta pinga
Eso es lo que pasa cuando uno da la mano
Y quieren el brazo entero2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
They tried to get rid of me
But from ocean to ocean
They gon' have to deal with me

I been overlooked, slept on
Stepped on, left for dead
Always against all odds like Pac said
I'm the living Great Gatsby
But these boys are watching quick and disappear like Banksy
From ocean to ocean, sea to sea
I'm something that you gotta see

Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

I practice what I preach, but I ain't gon' lie
I still got love for these streets, 305 'til I die
Still got love for these beats, that's why I spit this fire
You can catch me on a beach, 'specially on the islands
Took over my city, now it's time for the world
I live it, they rap it, there's a difference, girl
Getting paid more than athletes, man, life is sweet
GM on the status, Papo, watch me, (Woo)
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Woo)

I got the world on my shoulder, still quick on my feet
Nas say sleep is the cousin of death so I don't sleep
These boys act like they hard but we know that they sweet
They wouldn't bust a grape at a food fight, Papo, please
Went from rapping with them boys with a mouth full of gold
To hanging with Slim Jr., down in Mexico
Take it with a grain of salt, and a, pound of gold
The game is to be sold, and not told, let's go

Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never hadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
