"I wanna talk to you."
"The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears. I promise you it won't happen again."

Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?
I could be wholesome, I could be loathsome
I guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Without making me try?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly, mm
But all her looks were too sad, ah
So I tried a little Freddie, mm
I've gone identity mad!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door!

"Getting angry doesn't solve anything."

How can I help it, how can I help it
How can I help what you think?
Hello my baby, hello my baby
Putting my life on the brink
Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over? Should I look older
Just to be put on your shelf?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly, mm
But all her looks were too sad, ah
So I tried a little Freddie, mm
I've gone identity mad!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

Say what you want to satisfy yourself
But you only want what everybody else says you should want...
You want

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door!
"Humphrey! We're leaving."

You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompoms
Now you're working at the movies selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause I’m puttin' down my story in a popular song
Ahh, I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That’s all you ever need to know

So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in between 'em
Dunk me in the toilets now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, got everyone clapping, askin'
How come you look so cool?
Cause that’s the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh huh, I said that’s the only thing that I learned at school

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That’s all you ever need to know
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

That’s all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That’s all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car

Hey, what’s the big idea?
Yo Mika
I said suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
I said suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
I said suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Say love, Say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
Say love, Say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
I went walking with my mamma one day
When she warned me what people say
“Live your life until love is found
Cuz love’s gonna get you down”
“Take a look at the girl next door
She’s a player and a downright bore
Jesus love’s her, but she wants more
Oh bad girls get you down”
Sing it!
Suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Say love
Say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
Mamma told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you let her go!
Cuz love only gets you down
Now take a look at a boy like me
Never stood on my own two feet
Now I’m blue as I can be
Oh love, come get me down!
Sing it!
Suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Say love
Say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
I went walking with my mamma one day
When she warned me what people say
“Live your life until love is found
Or love’s gonna get you down”
Sing it!
Suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Suckin too hard on your lollipop
Oh loves gonna get you down
Say love
Say love
Oh loves gonna get you down
Mamma told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you let her go!

Took a ride
To the end of the line
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train
With nobody I know
But the pain
And the longing’s the same when you’re dying
Now I’m lost
And I’m screaming for help on my own
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if I’m terrified
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if we’re playing with fire
Oh, there is an answer to the darkest times
It’s clear, we don’t understand it
But the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you
I believe that we’re in this together
Don’t scream
There are so many roads left to run
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if I’m terrified
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if we’re playing with fire8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like its forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Wake up in the morning
Stumble out my eyes
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen
I guess I'd wish you well
A little bit of heaven
But a little bit of hell
This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, no love, no glory
Happy endings, gone forever more
I feel as If I'm wasted
And I'm wasting every day
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like its forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Two o'clock in the morning
Something’s on my mind
Can't get no rest
Keep walking around
If I pretend that nothing ever went wrong
I could get to my sleep
I could think that we just carried on
This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, no love, no glory
Happy endings, gone forever more
I feel as If I'm wasted
I'm wasting every day
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending…9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Big girl, you are beautiful...

Walks into the room, feels like a big balloon
I said, "Hey girls, you are beautiful"
"Diet coke and a pizza please." Diet coke! I'm on my knees
Screaming, "Big girl, you are beautiful!"

You take your skinny girls, I feel like I'm gonna die
'Cause a real woman needs a real man, here's why:
You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you 'baby'
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!

Regarde un peu tes amis
Qu'est-ce qu'ils vont faire de leur vie
Y'a de quoi se foutre en l'air

It's not the cowboys that are missing anymore
That problem was already old in '94
Don't be offended, this might seem a little wrong
Where have all the gay guys gone?

And to the romance when I was 14 years old
And to my heroes that were dressed up in gold
Only hoping one day I could be so bold
Where have all the gay guys gone?

If we are all in the gutter, it doesn't change who we are
Cause some of us in the gutter are looking up at the stars
If we are all in the gutter, it doesn't change who we are
Cause some of us in the gutter are looking up at the stars

So tell me
Where have all the good guys, where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?
Where have all the good guys, where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?

Thank you Rufus, thank you Auden and James Dean
Thank you Emerson and Bowie for my dreams
Wilfred Owen, Kinsey, Whitman and Rimbaud
Thank you Warhol, thank you patience, thank you Porter and Cocteau
If we are all in the gutter
It doesn’t change who we are
‘Cause some of us in the gutter
Are looking up at the stars
If we are all in the gutter
It doesn’t change who we are
‘Cause some of us in the gutter
Are looking up at the stars

So tell me
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?

If we are all in the gutter
It doesn’t change who we are
‘Cause some of us in the gutter
Are looking up at the stars
If we are all in the gutter
It doesn’t change who we are
‘Cause some of us in the gutter
Are looking up at the stars

So tell me
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys
Where have all the good guys gone?

It's not the cowboys that are missing anymore

Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow

You and I, we're really
Really not so innocent
Consequences won't be easy
From here, every road leads to regret
But if this ain't what you wanted
Then why'd you even come here? It's 2 A.M.  
If this isn't what you wanted
Then why'd you put a smiley in your message then?

Backseat, light off
Window open, stereo on

So kiss me in the backseat of my vintage Benz
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
When it comes, we can worry then
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
So kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
When you know how lucky we are
Oh, tomorrow worry 'bout tomorrow (Tomorrow)
Lying here together
Stretching every second into more
I know you're getting nervous
But this is a mess worth fighting for
But if this ain't what you wanted
Then why'd you even come here? It's 2 A.M.  
If this isn't what you wanted
Then why'd you put a smiley in your message then?

T-shirt off, breeze comin' in
Leather seat catchin' on the skin

So kiss me in the backseat of my vintage Benz
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
When it comes, we can worry then
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
So kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
When you know how lucky we are
Oh, tomorrow worry 'bout tomorrow

But if you say you'll be there tomorrow
Then I'll love you tomorrow
(Tomorrow)
(Tomorrow)
(Tomorrow)
So kiss me in the backseat of my vintage Benz
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
When it comes, we can worry then
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
So kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, who gives a shit about tomorrow?
When you know how lucky we are

Emily, that’s enough, do as you're told
Acting like you're 8 years old
I give up, it’s not worth trying

That would ever get her smiling

So, I was sitting there in the bar and this guy came up to me and he said "my life stinks" and I saw his gold credit card and I saw the way that he was looking at people across the room, and I looked at his face and, you know, quite a good looking face, and I just said "dude, your perspective on life sucks"

He's got looks that books take pages to tell
He's got a face to make you fall on your knees
He's got money in the bank to thank and I guess
You could think he's living at ease

Like lovers on the open shore -- What's the matter?
When you're sitting there with so much more -- What's the matter?
While you're wondering what the hell to be
Are you wishing you were ugly like me?

Blame it on the girls who know what to do
Blame it on the boys who keep hitting on you
Blame it on your mother for the things she said
Blame it on your father but you know he's dead

Blame it on the girls
Blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls
Blame it on the boys
Life could be simple but you never fail
To complicate it every single time
You could have children and a wife, the perfect little life
But you blow it on a bottle of wine

Like a baby you're a stubborn child -- what's the matter?
Always looking for an axe to grind -- what's the matter?
While you're wondering what the hell to do
Were you wishing we were lucky like you?

Blame it on the girls who know what to do
Blame it on the boys who keep hitting on you
Blame it on your mother for the things she said
Blame it on your father but you know he's dead

Blame it on the girls
Blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls
Blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls
Blame it on the boys
Blame it on the girls
Blame it on the boys
He's got looks that books take pages to tell
He's got a face to make you fall on your knees
He's got money in the bank to thank and I guess
You could think he's living at ease

Blame it on the girls who know what to do
Blame it on the boys who keep hitting on you
Blame it on your mother for the things she said
Blame it on your father but you know he's dead

Blame it on the girls

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you're young and you want some

Running around again (running around again)
Running from running
Running around again (running around again)
Running from running

Waking up in the midday sun
What's to live for when you could see what I've done?
Staying out of motion in the light of day
I was hiding from the things that you'd say

We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you're young and you want some
Running around again (running around again)
Running from running
Running around again (running around again)
Running from running

I was a boy at an open door, why you staring?
Do you still think that you know?
Looking for treasure in the things that you threw
Like a magpie, I live for glitter not you

We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you're young and you want some

Now I'm sitting alone, I'm finally looking around
Left here on my own, I'm gonna hurt myself
Maybe losing my mind, I'm still wondering why
I had to let the world, let it bleed me dry
We are not what you think we are
We are not
We are not what you think we are
We are not
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Love is a drug, and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction, and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug, like chocolate, like cigarettes
I'm feeling sick, I've gotta medicate myself up
Ah
I want your love, don't try and stop me
Can't get enough, still hanging on me
Your guilty heart, don't let it break you
And if you pray, well no one's gonna save you 
Like every one that your fear
And every thing you hold dear
Even the book in your pocket
You are the sun and the light
You are the freedom I fight
God will do nothing to stop it
The origin is you
You're the origin of love

Love is a drug, and you are my cigarette
Love is addiction, and you are my Nicorette
Love is a drug, like chocolate, like cigarettes
I'm feeling sick, I've gotta medicate myself
Well, if God is a priest, and the devil a slut 
Well that's a reason for nothing
Like every word that you preach
Like every word that you teach
With every rule that you breach
You know the origin is you
From the air I breathe, to the love I need
Only thing I know 
You're the origin of love
From the God above, to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you
From the air I breathe, to the love I need
Only thing I know, you're the origin of love
From the God above, to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you

Padre nostrum, deus machismo
Padre deus, deus machismo
Dione madre, deus machismo
Deus esso sancto spirito
Like stupid Adam and Eve
They found their love in a tree
God didn't think they deserved it
He taught them hate, taught them pride
Gave them a leaf, made them hide
Let's push the stories aside
You know the origin is you

From the air I breathe, to the love I need
Only thing I know, you're the origin of love
From the God above, to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you
From the air I breathe, to the love I need
Only thing I know, you're the origin of love
From the God above, to the one I love
Only thing that's true, the origin is you
Some love's a pill, and some love is a candy cane
It tastes so sweet, but leaves you feeling sick with pain
Your love is air, I breathe it in around me
Don't know it's there, but without it I'm drowning 
You're the origin of love
Ay-oh-ay-oh-ah
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
(Thank God that you found me)
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
(Thank God that you found me)
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
(Thank God that you found me)
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
(Thank God that you found me)
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
(Thank God that you found me)
You're the origin of love, love, love, love, love
Thank God that you found me
Thank God that you found me
Thank God that you found me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I’ve been crying for so long
Fighting tears just to carry on
But now, but now it’s gone away
Hey girl why can’t you carry on
Is it cuz your just like your mother
A little tight, like to tease for fun
Well you ain’t gonna tease no other
Gonna make you a lover!
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me
Girl in the blue with the big bust on
Wait till your mamma and your papa’s gone
Papa’s gone!
Mamma, mamma, papa
Shock, shock me
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me
Carolina sits on ‘95
Give her a dollar and she’ll make you smile
Hook her, book her, nook her
Walk away!
Girl dresses like a kid for fun
Licks her lips like they’re something other
Tries to tell you life has just begun
Now you know she’s getting something other
Than the love from her mother!
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me
Girl in the blue with the big bust on
Wait till your mamma and your papa’s gone
Papa’s gone!
Mamma, mamma, papa
Shock, shock me
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
It's not a sunrise over canyons shaped like hearts
It isn't bursting into song in Central Park
It's not the outline of your face drawn in the stars
It's a 'still-there-Monday-morning' kind of love
There's no dramatic declarations in the rain
It's not a love that finds its pleasure after pain
I couldn't train a bunch of doves to spell your name
It's a 'don't-know-what-they're-missing' kind of love

Our kind of love, it gets better every day
Crazy colors in the grey, our love
Tiny love, it's a tiny love
My life was dull
I used to walk in a different way
But now I'm dancin', dancin', dancin', dancin'
Don't care who can see me dancin'

Oh, tiny love
Oh, tiny love
Oh, tiny love

This tiny love has spoken
And bigger hearts get broken
(Oh) Tiny love
So small that you can't find us
The world revolves around us
(Oh) Tiny love
This kind of love, it can't be no other way
One kind of love blows the other ones away
Sometimes it's tough, others think we're acting strange
But it's our kind of love, our kind of love

Oh, tiny love
Oh, tiny love

My name is Michael Holbrook
I was born in 1983
No, I'm not losing my mind
It's just this thing that you do to me

You get me high on a tiny love
You get me high

And if it all goes bad
And our love sets like the sun
I'd give up a hundred thousand loves
For just this one
You get me high on a tiny love
You get me high on a tiny love

It's not a sunrise over canyons shaped like hearts (Oh)
It isn't bursting into song in Central Park (Oh)
We may be tiny to the world, but in our hearts (Oh)
We be giants with our tiny, tiny love2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
When I hear that sound, I know what's coming 'round
Thirty-nine degrees, too hot for the bees
The grass is turning yellow
Streets are slow and mellow
The faucet keeps on dripping
And the clock, it keeps on ticking

The swimming pool is laughing with its shiny, bright blue teeth
Laughing at my body as it's sweltering with heat
The smell of colored plastic baking in the sun
Sweet just like frustration, my senses on the run

I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
I want your ice cream
I want it, whatcha waiting for?
Ice cream, every bite
All I want is more

Ice cream
Filling up the car, the red door burns my thigh
How is this place still standing with temperatures so high?
Air and ground so heavy, thick with gasoline
My hands won't keep me steady, hotter than I've ever been

The swimming pool is laughing with it's shiny, bright blue teeth
Laughing at my body as it's sweltering with heat
The smell of colored plastic baking in the sun
Sweet just like frustration, my senses on the run

I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
I want your ice cream
I want it, whatcha waiting for?
Ice cream, every bite
All I want is more

Ice cream
You scream
I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
I want your ice cream
I want it lying in the sun
I want your ice cream
I want it melting on my tongue
I want your ice cream
I want it, whatcha waiting for?
Ice cream, every bite
All I want is more4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Oh Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Two kids, a dog and a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
He met his lover almost every single day
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
On some religion that he said he’d newly found
They didn’t know that his faith was earthly bound
Brown, oh Billy Brown!
Don’t let the stars get you down
Don’t let the waves let you drown
Brown, oh Billy Brown!
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh Billy Brown!
Oh Billy brown needed a place, somewhere to go
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind
Oh Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind
Then on his journey and his travels on the way
He met a girly who was brave enough to say…
When they made love, he shared the burden of his mind
“Oh Billy Brown, you are a victim of the times”
Brown, oh Billy Brown!
Don’t let the stars get you down
Don’t let the waves let you drown
Brown, oh Billy Brown!
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh Billy Brown!
Oh Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Two kids, a dog and a cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another manEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
In any other world
You could tell the difference
And let it all unfurl
Into broken remnants

Smile like you mean it
And let yourself let go

'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
To the world you thought you lived in

I tried to live alone
But lonely is so lonely, alone
So, human as I am
I had to give up my defences

So I smiled and tried to mean it
To let myself let go
'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
To the world you thought you lived in

'Cause it's all in the hands of a bitter, bitter man
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Take a bow, play the part of a lonely, lonely heart
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
To the world you thought you lived in

Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
Say goodbye
In any other world
You could tell the difference

I was born in that summer when the sun didn't shine
I was given the name that doesn't feel like it's mine
Lived my life as the good boy I was told I should be
Prayed every night to a religion that was chosen for me

Sold my soul, broke my bones
Tell me what did I get?
Did my time, toed the line
Ain't seen anything yet
Strike me down to the ground
You know I've seen it before
Make it hurt, I'll eat the dirt
I just don't care anymore

How could you break my heart?
Already played my part
I kept my promise, man
Show me the promiseland
Don't occupy my throne
Give me the crown I own
Lived like you told me how
Look at me now
I've got no money in my pocket
And the whole world's bringing me down
And the whole world's bringing me down

One person's lie is just another man's truth
We kept on running from the devil but the devil was you
Every time I see the light I'm falling deeper in debt
If I've never seen the good how can it come to amend

Sold my soul, broke my bones
Tell me what did I get?
Did my time, toed the line
Ain't seen anything yet
Strike me down to the ground
You know I've seen it before
Make it hurt, I'll eat the dirt
I just don't care anymore

How could you break my heart?
Already played my part
I kept my promise, man
Show me the promiseland
Don't occupy my throne
Give me the crown I own
Lived like you told me how
Look at me now
I've got no money in my pocket
And the whole world's bringing me down
And the whole world's bringing me down
And the whole world's bringing me down

How could you break my heart?
Already played my part
I kept my promise, man
Show me the promised land
Don't occupy my throne
Give me the crown I own
Lived like you told me how
Look at me now2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Jealousy, bring the music back to me

Dear jealousy
You know every part of me
Hiding where no one can see
I want you to leave
Dear jealousy
Why you smiling creepily?
Your fingertips keep holding on
But your tricks won't work on me
Oh baby, I'm jealous, I'm jealous
I'm jealous of us
I'm jealous of everything that I know we could be
But never really seems enough
I'm jealous, I'm jealous of everyone
Jealous of the man I used to be
And the man I could become

I'm jealous of your face, of your lips, of your eyes
Jealous of your house and the car you drive
Jealous of your truth and I'm jealous of lies
I'm jealous (Dear jealousy)
Jealous of the ground beneath my feet
Jealous of your mouth and the air we breathe
Jealous of the way that you look at me
I'm jealous
It's coming out to get us, get us
You better run away while it let us
'Cause like it or not, every day we get a little better
At jealousy
We got one thing in common, amen
Only problem is that it's wrong and
In every single person, even you, even me
Is jealousy

Dear jealousy
When did you move in with me?
This bed wasn't made for three
It's time for you to leave
Oh baby, I'm jealous, I'm jealous
I'm jealous of us
I'm jealous of everything that I know we could be
But never really seems enough
I'm jealous, I'm jealous of everyone
Jealous of the man I used to be
And the man I could become

I'm jealous of your face, of your lips, of your eyes
Jealous of your house and the car you drive
Jealous of your truth and I'm jealous of lies
I'm jealous (Dear jealousy)
Jealous of the ground beneath my feet
Jealous of your mouth and the air we breathe
Jealous of the way that you look at me
I'm jealous
It's coming out to get us, get us
You better run away while it let us
'Cause like it or not, every day we get a little better
At jealousy
We got one thing in common, amen
Only problem is that it's wrong and
In every single person, even you, even me
Is jealousy

Jealousy
Bring the music back to me
I can't even write a song
If you're standing over me (Dear jealousy)
Jealousy
I'll take the good times with the rough
I don't need to be the richest guy
I know enough is enough (Dear jealousy)
Jealousy
Stop confusing me
I am sick of seeing everything
In different shades of green (Dear jealousy)
Jealousy
It took a while for me to see
I thought I was the one who's jealous
But you're jealous of me (Dear jealousy)
It's coming out to get us, get us
You better run away while it let us
'Cause like it or not, every day we get a little better
At jealousy
We got one thing in common, amen
Only problem is that it's wrong and
In every single person, even you, even me
Is jealousy

It's coming out to get us, get us
We better run away while it let us
'Cause like it or not
Every day we get a little better
At jealousy1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
