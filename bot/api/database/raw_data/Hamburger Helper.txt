I been in the kitchen
Whippin', whippin'
I've been chefin'
Mixin with my left hand
Water whippin' and I'm stirin'
You want beef and I'ma serve it
Water whippin' and I'm stirin'
You want beef and I'ma serve it
I stir it, I stir it, I stir it, I stir it, I hit the pot with a spatula
I mix it, I mix it, I whip it, I whip it so good you would think I'm a natural
Water whippin' and I'm stirin'
Y'all want beef and I'ma serve it
Y'all want beef and I'ma serve it
Y'all want beef and I'ma-

You can catch me at the stove
I was whippin' up a bowl
I just came back from the store
Five Star restaurant at home
I just dumped out that whole packet
Add the powder, let it simmer
I was whippin', whippin', whippin'
Should be done 'bout ten minutes
Hold up, I told you I'm servin' that Stroganoff (beef)
Hot out the oven, it's molten lava
Ayy, I get some more for mama
Ayy, servin' your auntie and serve your uncle
Ayy, I boil the pot and then I drop the bundle
With my wrist until I got that Carpal Tunnel
I want tacos, enchiladas
I want pasta and lasagna
Boy, I got too many flavors
You might've thought it was catered
I find them noodles like macaroni
I say we chicken like Cacciatore
Y'all still tryna talk about some beef
But name your competition in my category
Aye, keep that heat on me
I be in the kitchen, 350 degrees, homie
All these haters salty, I'm too seasoned, homie
Drippin' down, I got cheese on me
Yo, Lefty make sure that we straight
I've been servin' ya up a plate
Lefty make sure that we eat
Lefty he stay with that heat
Only want beef with the lean in it
I added the different ingredients
That's why the streets show me love
Cause I've always been feedin' 'em18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Hamburger Helper eat it all then we dip
It’s been on the stove so long might burn my lip
It just gotta stay around me just in case I trip
And I cook it up, I cook it then I gotta catch my grip
Got the mac I got the beef and cheesy mix
Always got a pair of boots around in case I slip
Always gotta flip it we ain't stickin to the script
I'm a righty scoop up lefty then we going on a trip

Eenie meenie miney mo
Catch a tiger by the toe
We ain’t never letting go
Keep my foot up on their throat
Swervin swervin switchin lanes
Hamburger on my brain
Dreads long like a train
If I’m old I use a cane
Stack it up watch it grow
Young retro want some more
If I want a block on my woe
I rock the heat not the snow
They call you when they see you ball
They call you when they bout to fall
They ask me what I want to eat
Hamburger helper is all
Hamburger helper is all that I eat
If you don’t serve it then please take a seat
140 boxes like a tweet
Always on it man I’m sharp like a cleat
Hamburger helper boy no chicken nugget
Cooking it up in a pan or bake in an oven
Cook in all up then I mix in the onion
Hamburger helper it come by the dozen
Hamburger Helper eat it all then we dip
It’s been on the stove so long might burn my lip
It just gotta stay around me just in case I trip
And I cook it up, I cook it then I gotta catch my breath
Got the mac I got the beef and cheesy mix
Always got a pair of boots around in case I slip
Always gotta flip it we ain't stickin to the script
I'm a righty scoop up lefty then we going on a trip

Looking back at my past
Man I done did a lot
Only thing I didn’t do was
Ever ever get caught
Hamburger in the pot
Always dressed for the plot
Shoes tied in a knot
Red light gotta stop
Always gotta keep it real
Never ever kept it fake
Every year I have a birthday
Every year I get a cake
I don’t have to eat it all
I just have to eat some
Night time you see the moon
Daytime you see the sun
If you scared you better run
Ripping them cheeks and they done
We not accepting no crumbs
Its hamburger helper or none
Man that is all that we eat
I don’t think anything else can compete
I mix the mac and the cheese and the beef
Hop on that track and I kill every beat
Hamburger Helper Eat it all then we dip
It’s been on the stove so long I burnt my lip
It just gotta stay around me just in case I trip
And I cook it up, I cook it then I gotta catch my grip
Got the mac I got the beef and cheesy mix
Always got a pair of boots around in case I slip
Always gotta flip it we ain't stickin to the script
Ima righty scoop up lefty then we going on a trip

Ay, keep y'all cheeks protected!
Cause you know we out here, collectin' them like bottle caps
And you don't want anything to happen to yours

Some call me crazy, that might be true
Cause if you take my hamburger helper
I don't know what I might do
Some call me crazy, that might be true
Cause if you take my hamburger helper
I don't know what I might do

See I'm a fool for the food
If you take it, I don't know what I'll do
Flow sick just like the flu
Like bad cough and achoos
I mean, I'm thinking about the hand
The meats is on the pan
I know that when I'm in a jam
I know that burger gonna go HAM
I know I'm about six foot with an appetite to match
Give me all that with the seasoning pack
Confessing my love on wax
Sit back and relax, I Netflix and chill with the meal
Meanwhile, meanwhile, they're telling stories
They're telling stories like Jack and Jill
How feel, how you feelin', I'm the Hamburglarer, I'm a villain
Ice grillin' already, so good got me crying Mulberry
Belly poking out, feeling all heavy
Chasing these meals feeling so Chevy
Tasting these tasty treats all week
When you see me in the streets
Remember this 'fore you speak
Ah, cause I'm geeked
Some call me crazy, that might be true
Cause if you take my hamburger helper
I don't know what I might do
Some call me crazy, that might be true
Cause if you take my hamburger helper
I don't know what I might do

(Woo) That's me up in the stove (Woo)
Wanting more (You see me)
My favorite flavor taco (Ah)
Taco (Woo)
That's me all up in the stove (All up in the stove)
Wanting more (Looking on the shelf)
Looking on the shelf (Hey)
For some help (For some help)
Some hamburger helper (Woo)
Some hamburger helper (Woo)
Some hamburger helper
Some hamburger helper

Excuse me miss, I need to feed myself
Why I have the help on the shelf
A party meal's what I see
Budget's low so it's gotta be cheap
Give me a hand I need a savior
Could you tell me the different flavors?
I need a good taste, oh, I love it
So it sits well in my stomach
A couple boxes should be enough
Now I'll go home and whip it up
But first I need some hamburger
I need to quickly soothe my hunger
Alright, now this should be perfect
I'm sure the family will love it
This will help me no doubt
Now can you point me towards the checkout?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Yeah, got out of work and I'm glad to be alive
Got inside the ride, but my battery had died
Actually surprised, as soon as I said that
Because usually it's always the tire that gets flat
Just a set back, I don't even need to drive
A lot of us living optimists easily survive
So I headed west to get on the best route
Thinking for a minute, man I'm really stressed out
Don't live in the best house, don't have any nice clothes
Always dressing and second guessing on how the night goes
Then I might close, and never get pimped out
This is the type of thing that keeps me living with a doubt
But all that I'm about is just being able to blend
Food, family, and friends, we're bringing it back again
Whatever's happening is always better with your loved ones
Always remember that you will never be above them
I lost one, nope, I'm gonna be late
Never worry 'bout the weight man, I'ma get me a plate
And I'm heading to a place where we can just be free
A little bit of food and then maybe some TV
You better believe me, it was in my thoughts all day
Rather I was slow then just push 'em all in the hallway
But that's what we all say until the check comes
Your answer just becomes another hundred questions
This is for anyone that ever needed a hand
For my people in the front, to my people in the stands
If you got a plan, then just put your hands up
We're just looking for somebody to understand us
Everything's hard and the world's so cold
Forget about your heart, you better do what you're told
But there's always one thing that never gets sold
Think that you could use food for your soul
Everything's hard and the world's so cold
Forget about your heart, you better do what you're told
But there's always one thing that never gets sold
Think that you could use food for your soulEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
