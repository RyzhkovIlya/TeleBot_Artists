Ya tak privykla zhit' odnim toboi
Odnim toboi
Vstrechat' rassvet i slyshat' kak prosneyosh'sya ne so mnoi
Mne stalo tak legko dyshat' v otkrytoe okno
I povtoryat', ei lish' odno
Znaesh' li ty vdol' nochnyh dorog
Shla bosekom, ne zhaleya nog
Serdtse ego teper' v tvoih rukah
Ne poteryai ego i ne slomai
Chtob mne nesti vdol' nochnyh dorog
Pepel lyubvi v rukah sbiv nogi v krov'
Pul's ego teper' v tvoih glazah
Ne poteryai ego i ne slomai
I v yanvare pust' bvyotsya seryi dozhd' k nemu v okno
Pust' obnimaet ne menya, no pomnit vsyo ravno
I pust' sluchaino moyo imya vsluh proiznesyot
I pust' molchit
Chto vsyo zhe pomnit...
A za oknom sverkayut fonari proklyatyh dozhd'
Moi nezhnyi mal'chik ty prosti menya za etu drozh'
I pust' skvoz' slyozy prosheptala tihoe proshchai
Nezabyvai
Nezabyvai
Znaesh' li ty vdol' nochnyh dorog
Shla bosekom, ne zhaleya nog
Serdtse ego teper' v tvoih rukah
Ne poteryai ego i ne slomai
Chtob mne nesti vdol' nochnyh dorog
Pepel lyubvi v rukah sbiv nogi v krov'
Pul's ego teper' v tvoih glazah
Ne poteryai ego i ne slomai
 
Right, this is just, the truth of it
Ready
I’m just a cog in the wheel
Still I spit bars so they say I got some appeal
I may as well get to bleeding out my lungs
'till the fever I succumbed to
Gets to put me down in the ground then the fun's through
Stop your moaning, bitching, whining, snitching
We all got to play a part
This world we live in ain't a merry-go-round so don't expect to be so merry when you go around
Trying to talk the talk, or walk the walk
I suggest you look back to what made you how you ought to be
Being something you're not is the norm for me
Spent life trying to be accepted
Now I don't give a shit if they respect it or not
They can suck a Rick Ross track 'till their heads split
Listen to my music, your brain might improve its agility
Make it your mission to defy your abilities
Developing appropriate physical and mental approaches are vital to living free
So if you wanna be caged up, eat shit, blaze up
Then you'll wanna spark your haze up
Don't for a minute think you're gaining from that
Depends on the cause but the norm is some slack individual trying to make his way through life and it's truly difficult to realize that i am
Just a cog in the wheel
A fucking hog in a field
Eating up shit they give us on the TV like it's real life
But that ain’t the fucking world believe me
It's actually, harming you to see the darker side of you
This is what people in the world do when fightings through
They gather guns shooting first thinking later
Tell me now
Why you think the world is full of haters
Should i thank the newspapers for giving them ideas?
Or
Send a thank you to the movie directors or music heads promoting guns in their records?
Nah
To be quite fucking honest with ya
If I don't go nuts and I'm a cog in the wheel
Then you should be relaxed enough to hold back on a steel
Live your life like you wanna
Don't rely on others
Don't think about opinions just be peaceful and if people talk then you might wanna listen
You can make your own mind up from your own experience in the world don't keep your mind shut
Might take some time but you'll soon learn to feel
At peace with yourself as a cog in the wheel
 
I’m breaking down, aching now
Trying to get the flavours out
Before my mind degrades with all the grade that i’ve blazed
It’s blatant how i’ve lost the plot
Spitting hype has got to stop before i speak of all the grimey thoughts up in the top -
My brain is ticking into over time
Trying to deal with every potent rhyme I think up - best to keep my lips shut
Before i say summin stupid then i must re-write the page
I better make a move cos i ain’t got time to waste
No time, no time, no time, no time to waste (x4)
Ain’t got - ain’t got - ain’t got time to waste i got - DROPS
I think about the way I use the microphone to influence your mind
Ain't got time to mumble out some insignificance i rhyme
Because i’m certain it’s my time to hit the perch
So ima ride into the jungle spitting rhymes till they hurting
My lungs they get to burning, forget the toke u thought u took
U brought ur best attitude, bring it then I’m clapping u
Ain’t your bars bruv, just I’m moving at a pace
U can’t keep up and i ain’t got time to waste
No time, no time, no time, no time to waste (x4)
Ain’t got - ain’t got - ain’t got time to waste i got - DROPS
 
Right, it’s time to go back to square one
Stop slacking - start stacking up funds
Get packing up cos the raps done
Au revouir peace, see you in a piece son
Haaa, i’ll be back to rhyme again - when i get a piece
Of the pie i’m back in the game and loving it
But when i get no love I feel dark vibes creep up on another tip
Must lift my spirit up - ‘fore the vibes get me
Darkness falls all round my head
I see clearly now, before it was all mad traffic
I know the problem, too many bad habits
I’ve acquired through the years of mess
Though i’ll never regret the day i flew down to vey-gass
Spent my entire pay cheque, and 5 bill on a belt shit cave man caned it
I GOT TOO MANY BAD HABITS
I LET LOSE AND ENDUCE PANIC
FEEL THE BOOTH SHAKING DOWN
PLAY THE BEAT lemme rep the sound
I GOT TOO MANY BAD HABITS
I LET LOSE AND ENDUCE PANIC
DON’T TEST ME NOW
JUST PLAY THE BEAT AND REP THE SOUND
I'm a certified specialist, I bless kicks with a rhyme till ur record skips
Ain’t got shit on my lines while you rep the piff
I’m moving on from that stuff - i used to love it
But it’s like a bad habit, breathing that magic
Sitting round throwing cards down cash grabit
Then move on before i lose the pot, lose the plot, abuse my focus
Mind so hopeless
Got to push through dark vibes - to keep my mind from the plague coming down like locusts
If u ain’t good for man kind - drop to the floor then blow this
I’m rude and disgusting
When it come to bussin a rhyme i get ludes then I’m hustlin
Lick shots to the general public to get them on my vibe i know they would love it
 
I daydream in the night - i sleep in the day
Got nightmares creeping up on my brain
Inside out ima craft a change
And light up the mic with bars for days
No time to wait, no time to waste
As i move on i pass on the haze
Them days are gone now i bring it how i must
Daydream in the night in the day i buss
I daydream in the night then I'm up in a rage
Can't sleep till i get bars on the page
Tryna get my mind out of the flames
That still continue to blaze in my brain
''call the fireman please, cos i can see the flames coming outta ur teeth
Ur eyes swelling up to the size of a beach ball - bound to explode stand back people!!''
Ok, now I'm drifting off topic, let me get back to the beat n drop a little knowledge
I'm here to stir up ur porridge and invite the bears in
Get their claws let em tear into ya while ur sat in the chair
But you don't wake up cos ur minds feeling - rough
Try sleep in the night but we’re eager to bite any beats when they hit ima buss
I daydream in the night - i sleep in the day
Got nightmares creeping up on my brain
Inside out ima craft a change
And light up the mic with bars for days
No time to wait, no time to waste
As i move on i pass on the haze
Them days are gone now i bring it how i must
Daydream in the night in the day i buss
I daydream in the night then the day comes quick
Suddenly my brain ticks off with a click - - -
''lights out, here comes the shock be prepared to bite down''
That's the nightmares creeping in
Everything goes black and whats caged within gets released in my mind I'm at peace till the grimey beats are released on my mind i feast on the lines in the page, write in my sleep I'm alive so long as the beats get blazed out
Through an IV straight to my blood line then my minds infectious to the touch i'm
Out for the count don't stir me bruv
You can try to but i might swerve n duck
When i dip dodge n dive i bring it how i must
Daydream in the night in the day i buss
 
Right, let me tell you once
I’ll bring the bars, you bring the punch
- we can have a good party if u get nasty with me i'ma flex my bumps
- big man with the mic, ‘’who's that? - ‘’the kid with the beard and the funny ass hat?!’’
It’s m the a the k, s the i the m, go tell all your friends’’ then i'll be the next trend on twitter
That’s it - i’m next to blow up get set when I'm up -
Here to make ur class bunk n flunk their tests once again (hmmmm)
Spend more time figuring out what you like and what you don't -
You'll have good life wether you're rich or you're broke -
Be glad that you're doing what you do
Oh i'm off topic once again, sod it you
Best not get to test it
Try test it then you'll regret this
Spit bars to your next apprentice
And get him to sign up to be my next hit
And if he don't like it then he can rest it
Ain't some crazy guy with a led fist
I'm all about peace and love presenting
But you know you best not get to test it
Ready, set, here we go
Got bars for the beat so let me flow
I'm clearly wrecked - set to blow, sit down in ur seat like round merry go
Now ur on a ride with a psycho - when i fly i might roll into the night
So ride with me now or jump out n drown
When i bless the mic you can’t test this sound
- it’s like beating hard on the drums till i release whats in my lungs -
Then i pass out with the pen in my hand sat taking exams - ‘’i can't take this man’’
Spend more time figuring out what you like and don't -
You'll have good life wether you're rich or you're broke -
Be glad that you're doing what you do
Oh i'm off topic once again, sod it you
Best not get to test it
Try test it then you'll regret this
Spit bars to your next apprentice
And get him to sign up to be my next hit
And if he don't like it then he can rest it
Ain't some crazy guy with a led fist
I'm all about peace and love presenting
But you know you best not get to test it
 
(You see mystery, is an intellectual process
But suspense, is essentially, an emotional process)

To be quite fucking honest with ya
I had enough of all this shit
That makes me want to kill a man with my bare hands
I'm tired of creative shit
Some will understand the rhymes
Or some just can relate to it
So if you tell me that's the case
Just nod and blaze the rave for shit
Then bang your head to drum n bass we know you love the flavors
If you can't get down with the deeper darker side of me
The funny dubstep where I can feed you like a hyper G
Put me on the set I get their hands up high I see
This ain't a hyper set so keep them side to side for me
This is me explaining 'bout the pain is right inside of me
The undescribable yet undeniable defiant
That makes me less a be the M with every fucking line I breathe
So my brain is slowly plotting ways to stay away from weed
Cuz this seems to be the only thing that's
Keeping me from stripping in my grip from reality
Fuck it if you mad at me I play it right into ya
Fucking sick of sin I might say fuck but I'm a tick killa
Kinda like I marry Lime Hart behind the moss
I'm the pop landlord speaking like a fucking ass
But I'm smarter than that
Feeding you some evil facts
Bleeding your subconscious 'till you can't believe in fact
That I found a way inside your mind and
Now you're too affraid to find me
You wouldn't shoot the devil in the back so don't try me
I ain't leaving I've told you yet what's bothering my mind, see?
I ain't commiting shit for crimes of beating up guys
Me I'm peacefull in the mind
So why the fuck do I keep breathing evil
Into people when I rhyme?
It's difficult for me stop
Cuz people seems to like it lots so I just keep on spitting
Evil shit 'till I get writer's block
So that my mind is shut
And only time will tell
How long it takes for me to break inside this fucking hell

"Mystic Art"

So here I go again
Bleeding up my fucking sins one by one
See? I'm dropping in and
Each and every one's a problem
Some of them my mind have sow
But the bars majority will bleed me 'till my things are cold
Please don't cut the apparatus
Don't delay what's coming, take us
Deep and dark inside the mind and
Then you might just find the time
To look between the cracks then you'll find these five words
Engraved in my cranium
I start with the fake ones
You know, that relate to him:
Number one's gambling
Number two's girls
Cuz I don't know how to handle 'em
How the fucking brain works
Is something that remains blurred
Playing games girls that try to tame me but I ain't turned
We've been swifting on to three
That's the ghost beneath the beat
Loved ones who past but remain on my memory
Four's all the fucking draw cuz me in truth found a score
'till I'm so fucking leaned I can't hear what he says to me
Five's all the fucking jabs I've taken at my life
Yeah it's all fun and games at one's stage
'till you take a life
Luckily you weren't in that position
But there are people who are not strong and might flip if you start to diss 'em
And those are just five of my problems that ain't ninety nine
Not to mention all the other shit that's on my mind
Feel on the suffering when I'm on the mic
But when I'm sitting in the dark room sparking zoots
Blud I'm here to bide a bit and make it seem reality
Ain't quite a sweet
As you thought it might be
So fuck the world
Roll a fat L
And take a cup o' Vicodin
Now I'm high as a kite again
Scribing with a writer's pen
And this devil in my brain remains
Keeping me from making change, so
I've come fuck the guy cuz I won't hide again
Been hiding too long
And I double Devil's strong when it steps in my mind
And fuck it blud I'm fighting him
 
We call it Cutting
It isn't exactly that
To me goes much deeper
Cutting, implies separating something
It really should be called: assembling
Mosaic is assembling something
To create a home
Create an idea
♫ Do, do, you ♫
♫ That's the time ♫
♫ Feel like making dreams, come true ♫
♫ Oh baby ♫

Damn, I think I'm 'bout to throw my life away
Took a few pills
Now it's time to pray
Seen a few bills
I ain't tryna pay
Check the envelope
Sitting by the microwave
See the wardrobe
Better time o' the day
But there ain't even food in my cabin
And I ain't even bothered
Burn a spliff in a hideaway
I got an ounce and I'm somewhere by the couch
And some wine by the fireplace
No time to waste
I'm busy running out the clock so I'm mind-awake
I'm done looking for a job
I'm signing on
I wonder what could, would give them the time o' the day
I drop a cooch with a zoot
And fly away
Look at what I stand for
Still haven't payed my landlord
And I ain't gonna take your advice
Just a young man paying the price
Paying the life
♫ Oh baby ♫
♫ Oh baby ♫

I think I'm 'bout to throw my life away
Toking on the pipe
And wrecking lines until my eyes inflate
Pupils dilated then I see the light o' day and they shrink
Like my mind sinking into hyperspace
Trying to find the time where I can sit from time to time and blaze
But every fucking time I sit to write a rhyme ablaze
So it's difficult for me to find a medium to hit
Because I've been addicted to this shit
So now my mind is glaced
Trying to put together pieces of the puzzle page
See my notebook is choked full of rhymes I never say
So I'm waiting for a better day to spray
So I better get myself a couple lines o' K
A mistake
Not really knowing where I'm going in the game
But I'm slowly getting close up on myself
Without the hays and them fights
So I'm never taking advice
Ripping young but I'm paying the price
It's a day in the life
♫ Oh baby ♫
♫ Oh baby ♫
 
(HOOK)
It's the funk that makes your feet move in the rave
That and the fact that the sub is whopping out the bass
It's the funk that makes you put your hands up high
Reaching for your lighter, now we're heating up the vibe
It's the funk that makes you want to move
To any beat Maksim's blessing on youtube
It's the funk that got me where I am now
Knee deep in the game, screaming like James Brown
(VERSE 1)
It's the funk that makes your knees jump higher
Than the breeze through the trees
Like fire underneath ya
Making ya jump with no time for a breather
Get yourself up in the rave and hype it till you're looking meaner
Might just have to psych it on the mic before i bleed ya
Now plaster up that nasty cut before i feed ya
With the venomous flow that might just severe your throat
So you're remains are getting soaked up a and drained by the cleaner
Fuck it man I'm always on getting lean up
Roll the reef up till i cough my lungs out
And they start to bleed up shit
This ain't what i need 'cos
I need beats that are gonna release the free funk flow
That'll roll up on your speakers, please believe us
Maksim and Retrospect bring the funk flex that'll have your tongues wet cos your
Drooling at the prospect of bouncing in your sneakers
(HOOK)
It's the funk that makes your feet move in the rave
That and the fact that the sub is whopping out the bass
It's the funk that makes you put your hands up high
Reaching for your lighter, now we're heating up the vibe
It's the funk that makes you want to move
To any beat Maksim's blessing on youtube
It's the funk that got me where I am now
Knee deep in the game, screaming like James Brown
(VERSE 2)
It's the funk that makes you wanna come and step to this
So ladies go on shake your junk and tell em what the record is
It's the funk it makes you bounce harder in the rave
Much harder than your father when he's skankin out to bass
Throw the track right up, 'cos I'm here to bite ya
Working on the mic just like a viper with a hyper tongue
I just write to beats and when the track and all the writings done
We release the heat so you can beat your feet just like a drum
Step right then left keep it bouncing
Bun so many zoots nowadays i've stopped counting
But i know it's up to me to cut that shit before i bleed
From inside to out then i know you'll see a better me
Still i got the funk, but somehow i got the remedy
To make myself believe that i can spit without the energy
The high grade gives me, makes me feel giggly
But the funk puts me in the zone like HIT ME
 
Verse 1
Steam rollin thru as i breeze over tunes
- all i needs an evil beat to represent the groove
I spit to make u move, don't spit to make u snooze
Won't ever sleep, nocturnal beats leave ur brain bruised
Now the chains lose, see this deranged dude
Playing games Russian roulette with the fake noose
Insane when u feel the rush through ur veins you
Are witness to this fix, your mind is in the brain groove
Verse 2
Feel that tingle in ur cranium
That's the rhythm changing em
Brain cells split like we're breaking em
In two, if ur minds like mine then ur lazy with the groove
And ur laid back, hazy but crazy when ur let lose
Ima set the record straight right now
I just attribute to bringing all the rhythms out
Some spit n i see the crowd getting sick of it
I'ma let the brain groove flow till ur system hit
 
(HOOK, REPEAT)
I’m a big bad beast
Got teeth that’ll bite ya
(VERSE 1)
Got a flow like a psycho but i spit nice though
Bleeding your brain with a tight hold
Grip that i got on the pen when i write’s so damn tight
Someone got to pass me a light yo
Had enough of this blazing talk
‘cos the more that i blaze these crazy thoughts are
Coming right through me so i got to use beats
To make sure i don’t flop like a school geek
I’m revising the bars even after they’re written
Working hard to get the flow kicking
Snares might hit with precision
That you know you’re bound to hear when you listen
That’s right, we don’t make basic shit
We make crazy hits that kick through your front door
And we know you want more
We’ll hook the heat up straight to your system
(HOOK, REPEAT)
I’m a big bad beast
Got teeth that’ll bite ya
(VERSE 2)
Catch me running round your ends with my teeth out
Hanging lose ‘cos i been trying to bite beats out
Feel my gums bleed out ‘cos the beats so hard
Feel the kick snare combination heat your whole yard
Spitting wrote bars from the top to the bottom
Got retrospect on the beats here to rock them with the
Mad peng business shit man what is this?
I hear a mad track then it goes on my hit-list
And then it’s getting shot down with the bar flow
Maksim in the booth and i’m spitting bare hard so
You better understand the vibe before i come and slam the mic
I’m approving all the ravers with a stamp between the eyes
You’ve been accepted to rave here tonight
But i must warn you, it’s about to get hype
So before redman shuts the lights off
I’ma treat the game like a piece of pie and take a whole bite off
 
(Laughter)

I'm an anti anesthesic, sell it
'Cuz I fight with the rythm and
I write with position
Go poison
See things slowly imma go blind, need to just
Relax the beat straps it
Back it up, wind (Ugh)
That's some nasty shit
Got beats pouring out my ears like I've been leaking
Happens to my brain after a heavy weekend
They're getting way too much empty n' weeding
Have it your ways, end up fucked up
Trying to find the bar slot to take on to get roughed up
Tied to the bed pole
Slappin' 'till the head blows up
Feel that motherfucking head bruise
Shit
I think I said too much
And soon enough
I'll have parents telling me that
The kids have take control
That is all my fault
Fuck that
I blame on Asa for making the beat roll
Retrospect on the other side o' the scene
So
This guys make the beats so hype
And now I need roar
So keep handing over instrumental
'Till I go mental
And start writing to this beats a three four
There's no way you'll ever understand what my brain's doing when I'm on the microphone is a like a change to it
And you won't recognize this guy
Once he steps up on the mic
See his eyes
Got a blood so pristine
(I just gotta be me)

Why don't you find out?
Take a chance
Stars on the roof of my house (My house)
And if you fore 'till you're dead you know it's lights out (Gone)
Here
Take two, release and just pipe down
He's chatting 'bout flying off the roof, hits a cloud (Ha!)
This guy's crazy
He needs to relax this time
Before he finds himself trapped in his mind (Mate?)
I fucked up I told you way too many lies


I'm an anti anestethic, sell it
'Cuz I'm barely alive
I'm tryin' to breathe but my lungs have given up the fight
I feel disease and I can barely even lift my eyes
It must be the cheese taking me by surprise
Migrain's all over my brain
I'm trying to do this thing
But's hard enough without the fucking pain
I take a chance and switch up the fucking lane
Best move it before it hits you like a fucking train
It's the way I'm insane
I'm a normal guy, so
Why the fuck do I do things that might surprise ya?
Say fuck more than a threat
Fucking liar
Sit time dirty on the beat when I
Spit the fire you know you're in trouble
Best speak it on your bike on a double when I flex it
Learn to respect it
Any track by Asa and Retrospect man I repped it

Why don't you find out? (Yeah)
Take a chance
Stars on the roof of my house (Dance)
And if you fore 'till you're dead you know it's lights out (Ha!)
Here
Take two, release and just pipe down (Down)
He's chatting 'bout flying off the roof, hits a cloud (Yeah)
This guy's crazy
He needs to relax this time
Before he finds himself trapped in his mind (Ugh)
I fucked up I told you way too many lies

Why don't you find out? (Yeah)
Take a chance
Stars on the roof of my house (Dance)
And if you fore 'till you're dead you know it's lights out (Ha!)
Here
Take two, release and just pipe down (Down)
He's chatting 'bout flying off the roof, hits a cloud (Yeah)
This guy's crazy
He needs to relax this time
Before he finds himself trapped in his mind (Ugh)
I fucked up I told you way too many lies
 
It'd be cool to describe
Just how my mind works when I'm rocking mics
Lyrically I bust bars like I'm plucking guys
Each and every time you grab the mic you pass it to me bruv
I'm swing round the mic lead 'till I block your knees up
Watch you stack on the curve reaching for my reefer
So damn messed up, you need to take a breather
Relax, put your feet up
And just feel the fine flow
Drinking your system is 'bout to make your mind blow
Hold down I'm high so I might be tryin' to cheat a bit
Please don't take what I say to be significant
'Cuz this is me
Breezing through
Did a couple deeper tunes
But now I'm fucked up I also sing different shit
So you should leave by this point in the night
I'm way too fucked to be
Lyrically enticed
But tonight seems to be the night
That my mind's gone west
High as a fucking kite
Forgetting lines o' long stress

♫ Di Da Ba Dubby Do Dai Da Ba Dubby Do Daiai ♫
♫ Di Da Ba Dubby Do Dai Da Ba Dubby Do Daiai ♫
I'm sleep through dark when going on a crazy one
Trying to shake up dispute
And I can't help thinking
Maybe that we took it too far this time
'Cuz in some, crescent times
We all, need a release

I'm so gone west right about now
That you're bound to find me laying down in the street in a gutter
So messed up
Trying to find the best stuff
But I can't figure out why my mind starts to stutter
I just hid a chunk explaining to my brain
So my mind starts playing and I'm poking in reality
Trying to find the toke because I think I might be out of cheese
'Cuz the stress I'm feeling now I know the tight just won't relieve
So please hold your beef
I'm in no room to chat to do to try to chat a lot of breeze so
I'd be slimmin' through the haters that were there to try to break us
Specially when a star going off the point
What the fuck was the point in the first place
Shit, my mind's fucked up over my girl face
Gums bleeding now decide my mouth pretty sure I gone south
Hold down that's what stops me going now

X2

Ha!
Maksim
Nicola Holliday
There used to be a time
Where I didn't give a shit about the next bitch
Any question
'Bout commitment
Deflected
Rent a house for one night
Before she up and duck the bike
Can pedal fast and hard before she clocked that I layed it
Trust me
I was free like a bird
Busting jokes with the bees
While the honey's getting served
Take a toke on the trees
Not a woman in this world is true
That is how I used to describe my life in a turn
Suddenly met some real mad gush
Always trying to hook me in
To take a route to dinner spending my cash
See, at the time that I did a splash
Now looking back, thinking
What the fuck was that?
But a jewel ring closed
Spend a whole lot o' dope
Plus my sanity is been stretched low
So on the increase o' the cronic
'Cuz the stress that she's putting on my body
Makes my head likely to blow

Baby
Yeah
You cheated and lied to me (I did)
Are you really
Not surprised to see? (No)
Me going crazy
Crow walking the dark
Think you're so clever
Take a look in the mirror
You're the one tripping
You credible sinner
Aaah, Baby
You ain't Playin' Fair
No

Ha!
Right
Now don't get it twisted
This ain't the bunch o' cheesy rhymes
'Bout the girl in the club
That you missed
That would never be me
That you catched like a cheese
Spitting fake bars
To fake dancefloor geeks
But then again
I never thought I never get sucked in
Though it happened once
I used a cool hat
Now I'm called crazy
Felt like she fucked with my head every lazy
You get the kind o' girl
I mean
The one who says but gets a lean
And getting paranoid 'cuz of the green (Get paranoid man)
You can cry all you want bitch
I ain't changing the way I live my life for some dumb shit
But when I think about it
Suddenly I realize
It might be me
Making up this lies
So while I thought I was Playin' Fair
All that time
It was really that demise
Of my barely intact mind

Baby
Yeah
You cheated and lied to me (I did)
Are you really
Not surprised to see? (No)
Me going crazy
Crow walking the dark
Think you're so clever
Take a look in the mirror
You're the one tripping
You credible sinner
Aaah, Baby
You ain't Playin' Fair
No
(Yeah, We ain't Playin' Fair)
♫ Baby ♫
♫ Baby ♫
 
Tentronic
Maksim
Hold tight
Rise Up
Ready for this?
Check, yo
Listen

Right about now
Is about time to get down
Hold tight when I hit the set
I get into it
Then you get into a different kind of groove set
Hold on to the booth check
See me shaking loose but you probably told 'em
That I got the moves yeah
I'm rocking the mic and I let loose with it
Cold in the end and I might get rude with it
Solve for the killer beat just like a viper
Riping the mic and I might excite you
Suárez gets to bite ya with his
I will sting your mind up
Better get to listen if your eyes shut 'cuz I'm 'bout to
Rise Up
Through darkness
Keep bars in
I call this
Anybody wanna test me
Imma grab ten Gs and just jump in the booth
Then get awfully rude
As I crush the mic I'm speaking through
They got your speakers too 'cuz Tentronic beats are rude
I'm wrecking the sound when I jump in
And I ain't gonna fawn, are we slumpin'
Inject the crowd with something
Make 'em loud while beats are thumping
You're coming last if you're two nights in this game, boy
So I buck and bash 'till I'm crushing up your lady toys
Okay
Now that we got your attention
Imma get to addressing the beat in question
When I hit this mic imma teach you a lesson
Better reach for the skies 'fore the beat gets light
Then I reach for the mic and ammend at a night
Open the rooftops
Set for the flight
Then I'm blasting through with a mic so
Check this sound
Representing records loud
Beating on the drums
'Till my lungs
Get a fever and infect the crowd
Now they know that we won't drop the truth until their time's up
Better get to listen if your eyes shut
'Cuz I'm 'bout to Rise Up

Tentronic
Maksim
Hold tight
(Listen)
Rise Up
(Rise Up!)
Yo
We're 'bout to Rise Up through darkness
 
Hooooldin tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade
Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no more
Step in the booth get bars on the page out lining up high grade on the table
Who woulda thought that this guy'd end up fucked up tryna get paid through paypal
Gigs on the regs with culprate blaze out, hyping a set see I'm outta my cage now
Act real nice off stage then when I'm on the mic i'll unleash hype in the rave like blaow
Ye i run that, i'll do shout outs at the end so bun that
I'm gonna get real deep on the mic so hold on tight inside while i run this vibe right by you
Find that darkest part of the room and sit, on ur backside
Don't get up till the end of the track, I mean don't move or you might get smacked I
Need to calm, and get the words out that thinking about
Oh dear I know what this songs bout here pass me the grade and split that snout then
Bill another zoot and make it tasty, gotta make zoots bare fat when i blaze these
Then my mind starts turning deep head rush to the brain I'm weak in the knees
I'm startin to feel bare rough when i speak i'm holding onto this zoot
But i know i can't hold on much longer, half of my potential squandered
When i sit bunnin up zoots, loving up tunes, billin up hoots, killin up booths
My mind resorts to turning ill, the end is near but for now I'm still just -
Hooooldin tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade
Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no more
I ain't got nothin to prove if i get roughed up I'm bussing a move
I'm lean as fuck and I still might light these up before the nights through
See, theres no controlling me, its my choice if i get dope n lean
But i ain't gonna drag no one down with me, if its the end, then I'm gonna move swiftly
Quick see when i drift i get lost in abyss in the mist of a black hole
Tryna find my way back to the clean intact soul that i used to inhabit
But now its so, packed fulla dope when i toke its green thats causin damage
The truth is i should have really tried to quite time ago
But i couldn't quit so i gave rhymes a go, and now i'm
So reliant on the grade that i puff 10 zoots in a day and it don't even phase me
Apart from the fact that i surrender to munchies and get real lazy
So maybe its time that i gave it a break and changed up the mind state
Forget the dark vibes 'lifes alright mate', cos if i keep thinking like this
Then i ain’t gonna live for a whole lot longer, a diet thats consists of zoots and bongs
Well & truly means that my potentials squandered, when i sit
Bunnin up zoots, loving up tunes, billin up hoots, killin up booths
My mind resorts to turning ill, the end is near but for now I'm still just -

Hooooldin tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade
Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no more
 
(HOOK)
We bring the rough stuff
Kicking through your doors and
Breaking all your floors in
Till we’re rocking rhythm and rhymes
We bring the rough stuff
Kicking through your doors and
Breaking all your floors in
Till we’re rocking rhythm and rhymes
We bring the rough stuff
Tell them that we’re fucked up
Here to blow the bass till you’re barely alive
Feel your minds fucked up
Brain cells mushed up
And i really doubt that you’ll live to survive
When we bring the rough stuff
(VERSE 1)
‘cos we’re taking the sound to a new height
Maksim get’s strapped on the track and i do bite
So watch out for the big bad tunes they’re too hype
Watch out in the booth i’m too tight
So i might just strike on the mic, and i’m bringing that rough stuff
So you better toughen up before the beat hits you like a lose right
Swing and a miss now you’re pissed ‘cos you aim for the chin but you got no wrist see
All i got to do to hit you is shift and shimmy with an uppercut quick
You never seen something that sick
When i’m in the rave i’m swinging them fists like a fucked up killer
Bringing that rough stuff bonez and fifty fuck that’s illa -
(HOOK)
(VERSE 2)
‘cos we’re taking the sound to a new height
Maksim got a back strap and it’s so fat that
When you toke that you’re gonna want to run for your life
I’m so hype in the place, and when i spit
Bars in the rave just like the sage, i’m
Making the flow drop taping your toes up
Making you trip till you’re white in the face
That’s right you’ll be so white ‘cos you’re blazed
Here have some of that bass, it’s making you vibrate
Aching your sides till your mind can’t function
‘cos it’s full of high grade
Oh damn i’ve smoked too much of this shit
That piff must be some of that rough stuff we’re bringing ya
Trust it’s killing ya, turning your brain till you’re fucked like -
(HOOK)
 
As I walk through the valley o' the shadow o' death
I realize slowly that the reign of the left
Gotta dig myself out a hole I made a long time ago
It's the standard story
Too much death, too many wrong bets
Took a dive with the wrong skip
Burned too much green on wrecks
But I told you now I'm done with that flex
I'm ready to move on from these lean effects
Can't do shit when I'm mean at best
So, what's the point on me doin' this if
Generally all I do is wake up in the day
And straight awake get myself biffed
Then my mind shuts down
And I don't see how
I can sort my life out like this
'Cuz at the moment
I'm all over the place trying to run this race
Without knowing to go next
(My mind is a brick)

Take a left turning or the right one
Which one's right
I don't know
But either way
It's the next stage in a hype run
This is my life son
Got decks to phase
So I'm unlike any other guy
Except 'cuz I scraped all my strife
Comes to the surface
So imagine that
For a living
All you doing is spitting bout' the fact
That you got no purpose

So I'm sitting at the bottom of a hole
Trying to find a ladder in the zone
So I can make a quick escape
Trying to find my way
To that little place
Where I can say that I put that shit behind me
And started a new phase
No longer will I be grimey like you, waste
And they know who they are
And if they don't work hard
Then they're gonna end up falling back in the race
Second place won't do for me
Every time I spit bars
I just wanna bruise a beat
But that's just the impact
That you get from
Burning zoots and being a waste generally
Now I had enough of that shit
So I better pack shit up
And get back to this rapping stuff
'Cuz people seem to like it
When I'm on the mic
It gets the crowd hyped and I can't get enough
(My mind is a brick)

Right
Now I'm set
All I gotta do now is come through
With the goods at the end of the bet
That I made with myself
That I've got to improve my bars and my health
'Cuz there's no point in me
Doing this
If I'm gonna shoot and miss
With a flimsy L
If I'm coming through the fight
Then I'm gonna do it right
And build a fat one and smoke it straight to hell
 
Sometimes i feel the life i lead is not progressing much
I could strike a deal and still it would not be enough
To lift me out the rut I'm in, suffering a life of sin
Misogynistic popping this and that for shits I'm the binge man, rocking hype flows till you get singed fam, plus I'm hoovering up what's left in your tin man
Throw it on the table now, lets get all the papers out
And bill one last fatty till the flavour taters out, then i feel
Sometimes i feel, so cold, right now, it’s my natural habitat
Sometimes i feel the life i lead is not progressing such as i'd like it to
And i'm trying to find the light at the end of the tunnel where the fight re-news
And i'm in ur nightmares kinda like Beetlejuice, who's this dude
Taking on the world with a mic in his hand
Kinda looks like he's mad but he's fighting a losing battle
No matter if i win, i'll still be sitting here waiting on the fringe so I better dive into the jungle and see what i can find, better unleash myself from this mind
So efficient with the rhymes but depicting all the crimes that i could commit
Makes me believe I'm into some real sadistic shit
If i can't free myself from the world then i'll end up in a padded cell
Must free my mind from the evil inside or i'll end up bruck in the night screaming out like sometimes i feel
Sometimes i feel, so cold, right now, it’s my natural habitat
Sometimes i feel, that i can't really get with this
Emcee thing how the fuck did i get into this
Bleeding out my mind frame, putting all my thoughts out for the world to hear, see it's quite strange, how they might follow me but they won't follow guys in lab coats trying to cure the world of an evil hoax, Aeph knows what i mean when I'm down with the flows i get awfully lean and spit out as i go and i might not make much sense, fighting some odd tense need to believe that i must be off beat to somehow be unique in this game to get noticed, then i realised that i might just approach this in my point of view i'll write what i want to and hype how i want you, know that's the brunt of it, some may find they don't like what i got to spill - then I'm in my element where sometimes i feel
It's just the way i like it
It's my natural habitat ya know
Lonely - and cold
Maksim, mr bonne
Keep it rolling with the hip hop vibes inside
 
(Sometimes you're flushed and sometimes you're flustered when you love, It's never good as it seems when you down you got to get up again, but life goes on...)
So lemme take you right from the start
'Bout five years ago I've been writing up bars see
Was myself and G man we sketched a toon
We got togheter in the yard and started writing up tunes
And since then I've been able to express myself
All the darkest evil shit that comes and wrecks my health
You know you got to let it out somehow or some way
Otherwise is bound to drop bell up inside in your brain, trust
You'll never be the same again of the listening
If you fragile in the mind you might the one who listen in
But for those who will sit and hear the truth
Imma take you to the booth and let you into the rabbit hole
Dark rhymes about dark times
And everytime I get to spitting it
You know I kick it with a savage flow
Maksim 'bout to take you back in to the wreckage
It's my life man, too explicit for your records
Labels refused to rep the evilness in question
So I give it out for free
Listeners have my blessing
Quick shot
Your lights off
Find the littlest corner in the room
Crouched down in my trims 'till you're quite lost
Now you are very nearly in the right mindframe
I'm 'bout to take you on a journey that might change your whole personality
See that's the aim I got to change by the end o' the take then maybe I'll be free
(Come on fuckers, let's go for a ride)
