You know I'm loving every single thing you do

Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get wit' ya
Told me I could never get wit' ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
I played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but
I finessed ya, it was all a stresser
I was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down

My pride was the cause of it all
I apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause

You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
I know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

Baby, I shoulda listened when you told me
I would do better as a homie, yeah
Right there, I shoulda took a note
But pride was buggin' on me
I shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now
'Cause I know that it's useless now
You know what the truth is now
You swear you know how I do shit now
So I'll be gone 'til November
Talkin' old Timberlands in the winter
With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya
You always pick me up, I don't get ya
I been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'
You can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause

You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
Know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you

It's one of the crazier stories we’ve heard of, guys (I know)
As it's unfolding it's like—Fuck Tory Lanez, okay? Now, I’m from Houston, and he's from, bro
And to think that the whole night unfolded on social media
You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion
Instagram, in the pool with Kylie Jenner
Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report
Donkey of the day
Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, "It's more to the story," bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story
Tory Lanez got a lot of bad press
Serious, he's gon’ get deported
Donkey of the day for Friday August 21st goes to Daystar Peterson
So they got pulled over and she had been shot already, great
Well, hold up—
Donkey of the Day
What I’m looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, he’s the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry (Facts)
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, "We didn't even know she was shot"
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone

I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth

Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
I’m the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush
Coke blowin' out my fiend's nose like the speaker bus
Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B
'Cause I was coolin' right with Cuban, B, that was a stupid me
Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity
My heart in some foolery, this shit is just confusin' me
I'm goin' through these phases, but I gotta stack that paper
And the real estate niggas hatin', took me off that application
But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'
'Cause he watchin' me all on the news, but I ain't charged with no cases
Say the owner say my case is lookin' crazy, how the fuck that even make sense?
New times turn to past tense
All I want is straight cash, niggas say I lack sense
Star player, hearin' lies comin' from the back bench
Kill or be killed, that's the reason I don't have friends
Niggas lyin' on the crodie, niggas sayin' I'm deported
Oh, now I'm 5'3"? Niggas sayin' I'm a shorty
But lil' bitch I'm 5'7", money on me side-steppin'
And if I stand on my wallet, you can see my thighs in Heaven
One Umbrella gang and when we come back, don't you try reppin'
'Fore I let these niggas breathe, I gotta teach a couple lessons
Gotta see a couple questions: how the fuck you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?
How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops

Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G

I got bad bitches tryna have a orgy
Keep umbrellas for the days it get stormy
I pour the Henny for my niggas, that's before me
My outfit fly, you gotta seat out by the floor seats
She tatted me all on her face 'cause she adore me
They talkin' petty 'bout me but they lookin' corny
I had to fight for mine, nigga, you were sworn in
And God bless me when I wake up every mornin'
 
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it

His hair, wack, his gear, wack
His jewelry, wack, his foot stance, wack
The way that he talks, wack
The way that he doesn't even like to smile, wack
Me, I'm tight as fuck
Look

All I'm catchin' is niggas on Twitter, dissin'
And talkin' lies on they lives
I cannot recognize my ex-twin in full disguise
Since I went independent, these niggas want my demise
But I am yeast to the bread, my nigga, watch me rise
I'm watchin' niggas analyze me, how you protectin' me?
But made this whole plan to fry me?
Since the event, you never called me but you can't deny me
If you got shot from behind, how can you identify me?
It's funny how you got these lil' fufu, four plaque, lil' ju-ju niggas talkin' Zulu
I coulda made the shooters make a movie like it's Hulu
But who's these new niggas, talkin', boppin' and poppin' shit
But got less than four accomplishments? I got way more to lose than you do
Uh, watchin' the industry try and ho you
Asian Doll talkin', but shawty, I don't know you
I never met you, nor have I heard a song
And nor have I seen billboards
See your name in any cert or song from out your catalog
Oop, the hat is off
Behind that tatted skin, you battered with scattered scars
But I still respect and help you
Just don't treat me like you see me out in public
And I said, "Fuck it," and tried to disrespect you
JoJo, that was a bozo move
You tryna take me off a song that got you the most views
Got mad love for you, though, your label, they confused
They spent fifty on my feature, they fifty K in the lose right now, yeah
Nigga, play me, nigga, play me 'til the day I get to save me
I'm watchin' mad face and y'all niggas is movin' shady
Delusional, like
Like how that 1942 from Kylie house still got you talkin' crazy
Fuck a hail or handshake from niggas
The past months, the energy been mad fake from niggas
But I'm lifted up, bring Saran Wrap, talents gifted up
And if I drop this shit for a second, I'm back to pick it up
Unapologetically, jumped inside a pool and Kylie's face was lookin' heavenly
And though I'm innocent, they got this picture painted heavily
I pray that God remember me, faith done turn all my situations to a melon tree
Uh, J.R. Smith, it's the pot that piss
And you the last cat that should talk about some shots that hit
'Cause your performance and percentage, player
Rollin', ridin' benches, nigga, I'm from the trenches, nigga
You the type to buy a chick a eighty inch and still won't get a inch up in her
Yeah, I'm at they head, sprayin' hard like a spritzer, nigga
Baggin' niggas' ex bitches off a Insta' picture
Toes rufflin' through the sand like a Kingston nigga
Yeah, contradictions in your lines
With domestic pride crimes, we still have yet to find mines
Any time I brought these bitches up, you stressed it five times
How you try to kill the cat and then forget them nine lives?
I know it so well, I know these niggas so well
Jealous feelings, niggas best at catchin' like they Odell
It's rap niggas out here tellin' Megan she should go tell
But she won't tell the truth 'cause I'll be kicked up in my hotel
When the spiteful live shiesty, it's real trife
You niggas playin' Instagram, I'm playin' real life
Think I'm finna talk about a open case just for some likes?
I promise we done worked too many nights
Please, talkin' nights, we worked on a wage, flippin', turn through the page
We got Bun B on live sayin' I should burn in a cage
In these times of Black lives, he sayin' I should turn to a slave
If C pmiP heard that, then my nigga would have a rage right now
No diss to Pimp and Bun, but you made "Big Pimpin'," son
Pourin' champagne on women faces while they flick they tongue
I'm too young to give you lessons, but I'd like to give you one
Please stay the fuck up out my case, I ain't convicted, son
Chance the Rapp.. (Mmm, mmm), too irrelevant
I replaced his line with, "My chain lookin' Heaven-sent"
Next line, next line, 'cause momma always told me, "Don't you chew that food unless you would eat that shit for a next time"
I made too much money with Roc Nation
For niggas to be thinkin' I can't correlate the fact that it's only niggas out your roster hatin'
Contemplatin' these thoughts in my head
Like, "How the fuck these niggas callin' me, threatenin' me not to make no statements?"
Huh, the nerve nowadays
I'm hittin' certain niggas with the swerve nowadays
Gimme one DreamDoll hit record (Mmm), I'll wait
Ayy, Masika, this your chance, you in every Twitter debate
And every Shade Room comment like common sense ain't common sense
Like we be needin' your two cents and all your vents
Fakin' a kidnappin' for your OnlyFans
And tryna front like missin' kids was your intent
If that's the type of shit you teachin' Khari, then you should sit in a pen'
And watch people disagree in the end
You try to make it facts, but it's a L-I-E in the end
Oh, it ain't funny when it's your turn
When spectators got they lighters out with gasoline and wantin' yo' burn
Fuck a caption, this is facts with no cappin'
When Michael Jackson, Prince got they masters back, what happened?
Tory Lanez got his masters back just now and look what happened?
And Chris Brown, a Black man that changed his life for the right
And still, Black Twitter findin' ways to tear him down and bring him back in
A rapper catch a domestic, y'all start to talk that action
I feel like Famous Amos after all that happened
They want the downfall of every Black man, but I ain't goin'

They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
It's like, it's like, you gotta take into account
Most of these niggas got my number, like
You coulda called me, like
You know what I'm sayin', like
In the most sincere way, you coulda asked, like, nigga, like, "What happened? Did you do it?"
You know, even that woulda been straight to me, you know what I'm sayin', like
I guess I'm just different
But it's all good, nigga, I'ma continue to shine
You niggas could never stop me, nigga
You'll never put my back against the motherfuckin' wall, nigga
As long as my toes in the sand on God's green Earth, nigga
I wear the crown, shinin' notoriously and gloriously
I'm on a whole 'nother set of time, nigga, Super Saiyan five, nigga
Come out swingin', like Broly, you niggas'll never stop me, nigga
'Cause every time y'all niggas throw somethin' at me, nigga
I just keep risin', I never stop, I never back down, nigga
Back to the wall, I stand tall, nigga

Hustle with them dealers when it's time to get that bling for you
Knock it out the ring for you

And clap any stan fan that attract you niggas
See ya daddy was a musician that never made  it
'Cause when you was born nigga it was you or him
Shattered knowing he would never make it as an artist
And the odds of his life prolly be 2 to 1
But I give it to him 'cause he didn't run
I guess he figured, "man when you look at it in a nutshell
All I got is a failed music career and
My revenge is giving that shit to my son"
Nigga I'ma flossy nigga
They try to toss me nigga
The 45th I get em off me nigga

You a perpetrating, work for hire, twerk for payment
Busta Rhyme impersonating, worthless baby, irks him daily
Hurts to say it, burger flipping, birthed in 80s

Nigga walked in with a hundred rounds in him
And he's seen a nigga chicken I was comin' down in it
Glock nine nigga gotta run around with it

Backpack niggas ain't sellin' no records

Uh, oh look at how these niggas tryna ho a young nigga
I came from the bottom of the O
Never had a pot to piss in but I had the stove and got richer
Nigga, you know what we doin', I've been hustlin' to get myself a Cuban
It was all about the butter, I ain't stutter, ain't no Ruben
I got lot of money in the Balmain
Mixing with the Zara anytime I'm steppin' on the go, dog
Tell me why these niggas always hatin', why I always gotta be the one catch it on the low, dog
Nigga down to hit it with the four, dog
Got some O dogs, gotta hit 'em with the road, dog
Double Cartier on my floor, dog
I could say it under oath, dog

Been the realest, I'ma stay the realest 'til the day I go, dog

Give me just a little bit longer
Give me just a little bit stronger

Women love to fuck a nigga, wanted the kid with the hit
Rollie with the black diamond got the ties in it
I got a first class ticket to put the pies in it
I put a couple of bitches in King of Diamonds
'Cause shit when a nigga ice hit the light it'll hypnotize ya bitch, uh
Niggas need to get they shit straight
Niggas need to get they motherfuckin' shit straight
Niggas love to say I’m broke, how?
I was running around 50 thou' plus a feature named Bieber on the mixtape
I got the glass walls for the crib's sake
I gotta hit her that'll make the crib shake
I gotta take advantage of the chance that I'm granted just to see these hatin' niggas make the sick face, oh
How you love a nigga?
It's either leave it or pimp it if she be fucking niggas
I keep a oven to open over these suckas
I ain't fucking with these niggas
That hated but they say they love a nigga, no
Ain't no time for cosigns
Niggas wasn't givin' it, these niggas was livin' it up
Droppin' the rock, I'm pickin' it up
Robbin' the game, I’m stickin' it up
Flow stingin' like spillin' perox, still in the cut
Still in the cut for niggas think I'm givin' a fuck
Not never, I'm probably the hottest ever
Years nigga, I been on this obscure level
That niggas could never meddle with
We are not the same that's why we could never settle it
Lambo dark gray metal tint, it's evident
I don’t wanna fuck with niggas I know I'm better than
So I think you niggas better just

Give me just a little bit stronger
Give me just a little big longer

Who needs love? (Uh, yeah)
Yeah, who needs love? Ayy

When I got these diamond VVS's on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace

Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love? Ayy

I got 20/20 vision when I see her
Pulled up in the Lamb', should've pulled up in the BM
Rippers in my denim 'cause a young nigga was flexin'
And if we end it early, baby girl, then it was destined
I even had to stop, answerin' your calls
A nigga had you trappin' with the scammers and the dawgs
Drivin' over border with the hammers in the car
When the cops pulled me over, would've hand it to my dawgs
I mean, who needs love with these hammers in my fists?
And she gon' fuck me over, give a damn about a bitch
Debit, credit cards on me, slammin' in this bitch
Don't wanna take her back, she did the damage in this bitch
Tell me, who needs love?

Who needs love? (Uh, yeah)
Yeah, who needs love? Ayy

When I got these diamond VVS's on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace

Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love? Ayy

I said, I was doin' wrong back when you was livin' right
Cool a couple milli' sittin' with me on the flight, ayy
Tryna get me back and fuckin' niggas out of spite
And you sittin' on that nigga dick when it don't sit right with ya
Had to tell her, look here though
You could fuck a thousand niggas, only thing that's finna be hurt is your pussy, ho
And if I get at it, baby girl, you know I'm superstar status
Don't you ever try to play me like a rookie, though
Big, big dreams got you sittin' in a mansion
Laid up in my covers while you thinkin' 'bout expansion
Can't believe you even fucked that nigga, he a random
Had me embarrassed to tell the story to the mandem
Shawty, I ain't worried 'bout no nigga drip, I'm drippin' the best
The Cullinan seats orange, 'cause it's drippin' Hermès
No matter what she tellin' you, fuck, I dicked her the best
Fuck the drama, I put dick in her chest, yes

'Cause when I got these diamond VVS' on my neckpiece
Big pointers all in my bezel, call it my bestie
I spent a hundred and thou' and all countin'
Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?
I don't need no lovin' from any one of my exes
I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace
