Remember when I hated my life
And I said I didn't want to die
But I did, now I know the reason why
(I'm still alive)
It's because of this guy
Can you guess it right now?
Are you wondering how?
I found love so fast
And I know this love will last
How do I know?
How do I know?

He's with me from the start
He was always in my heart
Though I stray far, here you are
Jesus my superstar

I love you, Jesus
I love you, Jesus
You give me reason
You give me hope
Jesus never let me go
You can act bad, or you can be good
You can be from privilege or straight from the hood
But Jesus loves you, this we know
Never leave your side and he'll lead you home

He's with me from the start
He was always in my heart
Though I stray far, here you are
Jesus my superstar

I love you, Jesus
I love you, Jesus
You give me reason
You give me hope
Jesus never let me go

There was a time I overdosed
And I was lifted, not by the ambulance
But by the holy ghost

He's with me from the start
He was always in my heart
Though I stray far, here you are
Jesus my superstar
I love you, Jesus
I love you, Jesus
You give me reason
You give me hope
Jesus never let me go
I love you, Jesus
I love you, Jesus
You give me reason
You give me hope
Jesus never let me go4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
Remember when I was alone
Just a queen without a throne
How could I have known
My mind was gonna be blown
And it was blown
He parted the seas, escaped from a seize
Set all the slaves free
I fell in love before but the Lord, He opened that door
There is a guy, a prophetical guy

The bush was burning bright
Not an Israeli in sight
Smear the blood, pass over us
Moses the voice of God

I love you Moses
I love you Moses
You freed the slaves
And you freed my soul
Moses never let me go

יציאת מצריים ,זה רק ההתחלה
זה הזמן לעשות טוב, אז תחזרו לעבודה
בכל חג פסח, אנחנו אמרימ
!כמו שמשה אמר לפראה: שלחת עמי
השיח בוער בוהק
והישראלי באופק
דיברת עם אלוהים
משה קול ישראל

אני אוהבת את משה
אני אוהבת את משה
שחררת את ליבי
?משה האם תהיה שלי

Now when you sit down at the Seder
Let's take away the
We must always tip the waiter

Egyptian or oppressed
We must always do our best
No one below, no one above
Moses give me your love

I love you Moses
I love you Moses
You freed the slaves
And you freed my soul
Moses never let me go
אני אוהבת את משה
אני אוהבת את משה
שחררת את ליבי

All my fat chicks, where you at?
All my fat chicks, where you at?
All my fat chicks, where you at?
Now drop it low and shake that fat
All my fat chicks, where you at?
All my fat chicks, where you at?
All my fat chicks, where you at?
And show 'em why we thick like that

Show 'em why we thick like that
Now drop it low and shake that fat
Show 'em why we thick like that
Now drop it low and shake that fat

Yeah, you see me here? I flaunt my body now
Watch me turn it out, ooh, and you wonder how
Oh, I'm no stick figure, ooh baby, that's okay
I'm so beautiful in my own way


Ooh, baby, baby, I'm gonna pull this off
And you're super right, what your boyfriend do last night?
Oh he said I'm tight, now you know I'm right
I let him pull my hair, hair flip, bye, bye, bye!

I like the pizza, come on and give me fries
I like the feeling in my nice warm thighs, oh!
Come put your hand, command me like that
And find a little fat and baby smack that ass

Now, I know, I know. Fat is a word used to negatively bring down a girl with a little extra junk in the trunk
But being called fat is just a label!
A label put on to us by others who can't handle this wow-wow-wow!
So I'll take that label and wear it because it does not define me. You wanna call me fat? (Laughs) Well, you'd be right
I am F.A.T.: Fabulous And Tasty!

I should go and put on makeup
But what's the point when I hate my face? (What's the point?)
What's the point when I hate my face? (My chubby face)
So every single day I get (I get, I get)
A new personality split
That movie is quaking
The earth is shaking
When I walk, 'cause my thighs are fat (So fat)

I hate my life

Your life is better than mine
Your life is better than mine
I hate my life (Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate)

I got money and it still sucks
I can't stop eating, it's a problem
My boyfriend was gay and now I ain't got one
I got lipo, but I'm still fat (It didn't work)
Dragons don't exist, so there's that (What?)
I got on TV, CBB (Love that show)
I walked off and now everyone hates me (Everyone hates me, I hate my life)

You think you know just who I am
Think you know all there is to
Can we reach an understanding?
Are you gonna hear me through?
I gave you all I had to give
Gave you all that there is to
Now my heart is so damn empty
Said you wanna cut me loose

Well come walk a mile in my shoes
Watch these tears run black and blue
When my strength is nearly gone
I rise to face the morning sun

So if my lights start growing dim
And there is nowhere left to run
You better know one thing for sure
That I will be victorious
And if my blue skies fade to black
And if there is no turning back
You're gonna see me standin' tall
'Cause you know that I'm a warrior
If you say this is the end
You should know that I need you
We were meant to be together
Please don't offer an excuse
So if I go and fall too fast
Will you come to the rescue?
And if I can't escape the weather
Will you remedy the wound?

Well come walk a mile in my shoes
Watch these tears run black and blue
When my strength is nearly gone
I rise to face the morning sun

So if my lights start growing dim
And there is nowhere left to run

Silly skinny hater keep on sizing me up
Jealous of me 'cause I got a booty, like what
I'll be the next-gen trendsetter fashionista
A full force military coup d'etat
Yeah, Son Wolf got me on another level
I’m graduating from cadet to a general
Now my grind get's dirty, my bass gets low
My vibes in the cut, you’re behind tempo

Solar flare burning up the discotheque
Sweat dripping twerking got you soaking wet
Yeah, DJ spinning on my new LP
To the window to the wall, I'm a real O-G
I'm coming slick with the lyric, make you hydroplane
Using top shelf  too cool to claim
Sweet as Ghirardelli, fresh as Febreze
Now I'ma break down for you like a D-O double G
I'll be the natural rolling back Casanova
Smooth, sweet talk could make your panties drop
Now, pulls pumpin' deeper between these sheets
Your body shaking all over screaming

The elite, undisputed, world champion
Flawless with every single imperfection
Dated young marquees, star of the show
Serving up all you salty bitches vertigo

Fresh water guppy, welcome to the shark tank

Ain’t no plastic housewife, it's a pinup girl

Little girl searching
Hoping for an answer to her prays
Oh there better be an answer
Little girl lost
Can't get the love she needs
Searching out to the world
But it's all so big

I gotta find something more
So lonely on this world
This little girl's got some pain
Oh I need forgiveness

Once upon a time I was a little girl
Who looked up but never found what should be mine
If I only knew I had him with me from earth
Oh he blessed me
Cause he put me on this Earth
Cause he put me on this Earth

I'm gonna hang my head now
And look deep inside
And pray for another day
I wish it would go away
Little girl are you lost?
When will you come home?
But I am here to say "there is a way out"


I was lost now
But now I'm found
I've turned my life around
My life around
He lifts me up
And gives me hope
He gave me love
And now I love
And now I love
I'm gonna hang my head now
And look deep inside
And pray for another day
I wish it would go away
Go away (x6)

All my life I've been a good little girl
All my life I hid myself from the world
(Hey, hey)
Desperate for love, silently seeking attention
And other things I'd rather not mention
(Hey, hey)

Don't look at me, I don't wanna be seen
Something’s the matter with me
Don't look at me, I don't wanna be seen
Something’s the matter with me

I got daddy issues, that's all that I've been hearing
I got daddy issues, nobody bothers listening
To my daddy issues
So I'm gonna keep on living life this way (Hey)
Life this way (Hey), life this way (Hey), life this way (Hey)

All my life I've been so different
All my life I've been resistant
(Hey, hey)
To the man, show I can survive in this world alone
(Hey, hey)
Don't look at me, I don't wanna be seen
Something’s the matter with me
Don't look at me, I don't wanna be seen
Something’s the matter with me

I got daddy issues, that's all that I've been hearing
I got daddy issues, nobody bothers listening
To my daddy issues
So I'm gonna keep on living life this way (Hey)
Life this way (Hey), life this way (Hey), life this way (Hey)

Reckless, helpless, I'm a mess
Hopeless, loveless, I confess
I just wanna be hugged, I just wanna be loved
And do what it takes to feel alive, I'll take your life

I got daddy issues, that's all that I've been hearing
I got daddy issues, nobody bothers listening
To my daddy issues

It's Christmas time and for many that means
Presents, and trees, and time off work
But not for me and not this song
This is about Jesus' day of birth
Happy Birthday, Jesus

Many years ago, over 2k or so
A virgin conceived and the world went, 'Woah!'
No, she wasn't a hoe, it was so much more
Not a trip, just the birth of our dear savior
The Lord our God, I've known for so long
But, I wanted to share my love in a song
This time of year I always reflect
When the word became flesh and knew he was fresh
He gave us his best, his son, his test
So, thank you God for sending your boy
On December twenty-fifth (Let's all make some noise)
I may look like a thot but I'm a Christian girl
I was trying to praise the light of this world

The light of this world arrived to us all
Happy birthday, to the Messiah
It's not about the gifts or your super hot wife
It's about the day God gave us eternal life
Jesus is born, Jesus is born
Who needs antidepressants, when Jesus is born?
Jesus is born, Jesus is born
There will be peace on earth when Jesus is born

So now when you see the star in the sky
Never ask, 'when,' or 'how' or 'why'
That angel gonna kick you in the butt
Jerusalem who? Emmanuel what?
You're going to get ahead, the start of new
All hail this boy, the king of Jews
Are you smiling big? Good! That's joy
Are you greatness in hope? That's great boy
Don't forget when eating that Christmas ham
That Christmas is for Christ and his birth in Bethlehem

The light of this world arrived to us all
Happy birthday, to the Messiah
It's not about the gifts or your super hot wife
It's about the day God gave us eternal life

Jesus is born, Jesus is born
I don't want to die because Jesus is born
Jesus is born, Jesus is born
Let's all give hugs because Jesus is born
Oh Oh (Oh) Oh Oh
Here we go, Here we go

For God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten
This is my shot, you'll see hoppin' and we'll all be saucin'
We will cherish and not perish
We've believe, gotta believe. Don't you see?
We've got the light and the darkness, the war we've never fought in
Our sentence, Israel, repentance. Do I make sense?
We've got to pray, we've got to win. Like, Acts 5:31, forgive our sins

Jesus is born, Jesus is born
I'm still alive because Jesus is born
Jesus is born, Jesus is born
Happy holiday because Jesus is born

And please no more shootings this holiday season
Thank you!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
He's got them blue eyes
And that soft, soft skin
Oh that baby face that drives the ladies in
He's so cool and all so sweet
The kind of guy you want your parents to meet
He may be a movie star
But that's not all

He's the man who stole my heart
Only not at all

I'm off in candyland
With all the fingers
'Cause I first fell in love
When I was only 10
Now I'm still in love with Leonardo
'Cause we are star-crossed lovers
More than Juliet and Romeo
We be mister and misses
Well Leonardo
Leonardo DiCaprio
Then I fell to your paradise
Leonardo DiCaprio
Leonardo, Leonardo
Oh a ship that sinked my teenage love
I started loving you from above
Wetter than Titanic, dream me like Inception
I love you so
He could whip me every night
Just like django
And when my eyes are red here
If you know I was here

'Cause I first fell in love
When I was only 10
Now I'm still in love with Leonardo
'Cause we are star-crossed lovers
More than Juliet and Romeo
We be mister and misses
Well Leonardo

I may be white, but I got needs too
And I gotta do what I feel like doing
So I'ma get out of the valley
Go down to Inglewood
And get me some

People stop and stare
They look at my body right pass my face
People stop and stare, and stare a little more
Looks like I'm out of place, an interracial war
I can't help myself when I see
A man in fab  jeans, might fan his team
Give me some cornrows or dreads down there
What's inside your pants, really isn't there?

'Cause I got jungle fever, It's driving me insane
I got jungle fever and I can't complain
Oh, when you have jungle fever, you get satisfied
So get some jungle fever and melt them inside

Take me to a Tyler Perry movie, It's a done deal
Get me home in bed
See the top of my head

Gunshots, heard from afar
But no one ever cares about the falling star
Who you with, but now
Who you are these
Are the things that shape tiny little scars

(How much more?)
Can I take
(How many stones?)
Until I break
Was this all my mistake
Was it real, was it fake?
I can't help, but be myself, I got this

Big heart, loud mouth in the moment
Road blocks all shock, keep it going
Your love comes in like violence
Stays for while then leaves
With the silence, ooh

Rumors, it loud like thunder
While the truth is slipping right under
Who's the fault for, all of this for?
And can we ever erase these tiny little scars?

'Tis the season for all the girls out there to be hot
Mmm, let me tell you a story

Had a boyfriend at the start of the year
He was just about as real as a flying reindeer
He really loved to fight, snuck out on story night
But the boy just had to go
Jesus came in, gave me revelations
But I can't say no to a big temptation
I think his name was Sean, he was on vacation
But his fuzzle too low, so he wasn't staying

Oh boy, you're hot (Look at that butt)
But is that your car? (What's that?)
Excuse me, is that a hoopty?
Oh baby, who you think you're fooling?
It's a hot girl Christmas
Don't need no Santa Clause to fill my wish list
'Cause I got it all

And if I need it, I'ma buy it
I'ma get a Lamborghini or some diamonds

Usually by now all of the crying and the spending and complaining, yeah, this boy would go home (go home)
Naming all my children I'd get an overwhelming feeling by now, it's uncomfortable

Why won't you go run away from me? You'll probably regret staying one day, you'll see, but for now I'll sing

La, la la la la. What did I do to deserve you? A crazy like me a desperate like you they say if it fits then just wear the shoe. I found someone incredible, found someone incredible
La, la la la la. Found someone incredible, found someone incredible. La, la la la la. Found someone incredible, found someone incredible

Usually by now she'd start to bounce and figure out that I am needing her more than she knows. The smell of desperation coming from the perspiration but I'm feeling like DiCaprio

Why won't you go run away from me-e-e-e? You'll probably regret staying one day, you'll see, but for now I'll sing

La, la la la la. What did I do to deserve you? A crazy like me a desperate like you they say if it fits then just wear the shoe. I found someone incredible, found someone incredible
La, la la la la. Found someone incredible, found someone incredible. La, la la la la. Found someone incredible, found someone incredible

Breakfast in bed and 'til the end, you look so amazing
Got some regrets but baby I guess it looks like I'm staying
You're stuck with my love got no choice but to give it up and every Valentine you have to be mine
And you're stuck with my love got no choice but to give it up and every Valentine you have to be mine
La, la la la la. (What did I do) What did I do to deserve you? A crazy like me a desperate like you they say if it fits then just wear the shoe. I found someone incredible, found someone incredible
La, la la la la. Found someone incredible, found someone incredible. La, la la la la. Found someone incredible, found someone incredible1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
