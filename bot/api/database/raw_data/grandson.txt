We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?

Look me in my eyes
Tell me everything's not fine
Oh, the people ain't happy
And the river has run dry
You thought you could go free
But the system is done for
If you listen real closely
There's a knock at your front door

We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?

When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)

Beg me for mercy
Admit you were toxic
You poisoned me just for
Another dollar in your pocket
Now I am the violence
I am the sickness
Won't accept your silence
Beg me for forgiveness

We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?

When there's blood in the water
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

I am the people
I am the storm
I am the riot
I am the swarm
When the last tree's fallen
The animal can't hide
Money won't solve it
What's your alibi? (Alibi, alibi)
What's your alibi? (Alibi, alibi)
What's your alibi? (Alibi, alibi)
What you gon' do when there's blood in the
Blood in the water?

When there's blood in the water
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the
(Oh, oh)
When there's blood in the water
 
I was higher than the nosebleed, I
Turn up 'til my nose bleed, I
Blacked out in the black car, I
Was trying to feel like a rockstar, but
I can't just do one now, no
I've been way too numb now
I'm living on the run now
Oh, I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the drugs don't work

Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

I couldn't find the fill again, I
Couldn't seem to kill the pain, I
Was living in the moment
Searching for a little serotonin
But, this shit ain't so fun now, I
Can't tell what the comedown, I
Been living on the run now
Oh I gotta get out of this town somehow

'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the bad's been slowly getting worse
In this fast lane, living, it's a curse
Better tell me, what's your life worth?
I think it's time for a change
'Cause the drugs don't work

Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work
Anymore, anymore
Anymore, now the drugs don't work

There is no need for anyone to suffer in pain anymore
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Overdose, overdose, overdose
Overdose, overdose, overdose
All fun and games till I hit the floor comatose

Overdose, all fun and games till I hit the floor comatose
Overdose
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Overdose, all fun and games till I hit the floor comatose
Overdose!
 
(No thoughts, no prayers)
(Can bring back what's no longer there)
(The silent are damned)
(The body count is on your hands)

Smile for the camera
Another politician bought
I swear I heard another shot
Cash another payment
Red all on the canvas
It's murder on the campus
Another press conference
Nothing gets accomplished
The suit is an accomplice
Money is the motive
The war is in the street
Watch history repeat

No thoughts and no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

They lobby for the violence
It's a governmental shakedown
Welcome to my breakdown
Bulletproof backpacks
They wanna arm the teachers
I think I saw the reaper
Fear's good for profit
Deregulate the casket
They're lyin' to the masses
How much will it take
'Til you get buried in the coffin that you make?
Heaven's sake

No thoughts, and no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

No thoughts, no prayers
Can bring back what's no longer there
The silent are damned
The body count is on your hands

Turn off all the lights, nobody make a sound
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
Are we out of time?
Can we turn this all around?
Are we out of time?
Will we all fall?
(We all fall down)

The body count is on your hands
The body count is on your hands
No thoughts (no thoughts)
No prayers (no prayers)
No thoughts (no thoughts)
The body count is on your hands
No thoughts (no thoughts)
No prayers (no prayers)
No thoughts (no thoughts)
The body count is on your hands (on your hands)
 
The goodbye is the hardest part
When we find ourselves back at the start
But I'm not so brave, and I'm not so smart
No, I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor
One day you will understand
Why I pushed you away as I ran
And you will find a better man than I am
Trust, I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor (Ooh)

Despicable, I'm just a bottom feeder
I'm despicable, I ain't never been a keeper
I'm despicable, love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

The boy who fell into the sky
Had no one there to watch him cry
He looked at you with his empty eyes
And said, "I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor" (Ooh)

Despicable, I'm just a bottom feeder
I'm despicable, I ain't never been a keeper
I'm despicable, love her then I leave her
And if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither

I wouldn't love me neither
Despicable

How I wish I told a different tale
Like we chased the light, and his love prevailed
But his blood ran cold, and his skin went pale
She got a letter in the mail, it said: "I'm doing you a favor, doing you a favor"

Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
(Love her then I leave her) No
(Love her then I leave her)
Said if I were you
Said if I were you, I wouldn't love me neither
 
When I go into the ground
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
When I go into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down

From the rubble, what do I see?
There's a whole damn army thinkin' that they're gonna harm me
Say goodnight, I'll never get free
Oh, I got troubles that won't let me be
But I won't get tired, set the town on fire
'Till my troubles got trouble with me

Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go into the ground
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
When I go into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down

I've been on the run
Since I was a boy
But now I'm done runnin', got another thing comin'
Watch my enemies get destroyed
Oh, I've got troubles of more than one kind
But I never sleep, gotta bury me six feet deep
Where the sun don't shine

Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go into the ground
I won't go quietly, I'm bringin' my crown
When I go into the ground
Oh, they gotta bury me, bury me face down

I've been counted out, left for dead
Wanted with a bounty on my head
But somehow, someway, I'm-a keep movin' along, movin' along
Been counted out, left for dead
Wanted with a bounty on my head
But somehow, someway, I'ma keep movin' along, along

Thinkin' that they've won
It's only just begun

When I go (When I go)
Into that ground (Into that ground)
I won't go quietly (Won't go quietly)
I'm bringin' my crown (Bringin' my crown)
And when I go into the ground (into that ground)
Oh, they gotta bury me (bury me)
Bury me face down (bury me face down)
Oh, they gotta bury me
Bury me face down
 
I never learned from my mistakes
Until I'm too late to do anything
A screen glows in a dark room
Laptop talk of a change that never came
Oh no, no, no

So come show me
Just what to do and how to fix it
I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends

I'm just reading about flaws that I didn't know I had
Watching ads for things I didn't know I need
Oh no, no, no
Pour a drink just to stop the shakes
Blowing smoke until my eyes bleed
Mm, mm, mm, mm

Oh come show me
Just what to do and how to fix it
I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends

Sometimes you gotta leave that city to love that city and start all over again
But it doesn't look so pretty to get your hands dirty and start all over again
You gotta leave that city to love that city or else you might get trapped
Oh, you might get trapped
Just like all of my
Just like all of my

Oh, just like all of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along
Oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends
 
Mm, mm-mm, hmm-mm-mm
Mm, hm, mm

Nobody really cared, so it never really mattered
It never really mattered, so it never really happened
What's the point in fightin' for a happy ever after?
The past keeps hauntin' the future I imagine (Wha—)
All I ever wanted was a little peace and quiet
Just color in the lines, and you'll get it like they promise
If you bite the hand, get louder and defiant
Then you'll see how quickly they come making a deposit

One false move, you're a Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity

Mass detention, debt collection, misdirection
Got lost, missed intervention
We missed redemption, missed reflection, kissed the weapon
Skipped the lesson, caught an infection
Mass confusion, air pollution
Compromise foreign contribution
Mass epidemic, no mask in a mass, call the medic
Go fast, do I last? Apathetic
Might crash, I'm a hack, I'm pathetic, I know
Times ain't changin', the sun don't show
When the trees won't grow, when the bars keep droppin'
The fake tan on the TV keep talkin'
Just wanna be optimistic
My sanity's gone off, ballistic
Train was leavin', I just missed it
Guess that I'm stuck with this shit, damn

One false move, you're a Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity

I'm still tryna find my identity

One false move, you're a Kennedy
If you fight it, you're the enemy
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
Where's my head on the podium?
Gas me up, no petroleum
I'm so sick, but I can't find a remedy
I'm still tryna find my identity
 
Now Tommy's a good father
Two sons and a daughter
But he wakes up and he asks himself
"Why even bother?"
If he cannot feed his family
The wage he's paid's insanity
Every day he's dealing with a new calamity
Lost his old occupation
But it wasn't immigration
It was a machine, automation that replaced him
Politicians left him, corruption since the Recession
So he grabs his Smith & Wesson and says he'll teach 'em all a lesson like

"Get down on the ground!
It's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”

Now first he'd lost his pension
Sunk into depression
Congress is defecting
It's been adding to the tension
Came back from war, and he's been post-traumatic stressing
Can't afford his medicine he took for his aggression
He needs help, relying on the system that rejects him
Took away his benefits, but left him with his weapon
Bought a one-way ticket
He's entering the thicket
To do the only thing that he's thinking will make a difference like

"Get down on the ground!
It's a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”

There's a cold wind blowing
I'm just warning and preparing ya
There's a cold wind blowing
And it's coming for America!
And it's coming for America!
And it's coming for America

"Get down on the ground!  (On the ground)
It's a stick-up! Nobody make a sound! (Make a sound)
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round! (Emptying a round)
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound! (Nobody make a sound)
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round! (Emptying a round)
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
 
Is it time to lead or is it time to die?
Time to raise hell or walk on by?
Is there anybody out there that's payin’ attention?
Yeah, yeah

Time for peace or is it time for violence?
Is there anybody out there that's payin' attention?
Yeah, yeah

Do you love a sunset?
Aren't you fed up yet?
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

Yeah, yeah
To go and get your hands dirty

I got a skeleton under the floorboard
I got a secret I need you to keep
Run away, run away, you have been forewarned
I don't wanna go off in the deep
If we don't do somethin’, we’ll be stuck up in the mud again
Don't wanna mess it up ’cause I want everything and nothing at all
I've got a feeling when they walkin' on the ceilin'
That the people needed healin’ and they know

Tell me what you tryna hide
And what you runnin' from inside
'Cause I got a surprise
We might not make it to the mornin'
So go on and tell me now

Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

Do you love a sunset?
Aren't you fed up yet?
Do you have enough love in your heart
To go and get your hands dirty?

Yeah, yeah
To go and get your hands dirty
 
I lose a bit of myself with every selfie
Lose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy
Finding a new religion on Yelp to come help me
Praying to the label itself, "Do not shelf me"
In the middle with the beggars and rejects
Reading between text with weed, liquor, and sex
She say she love me at dusk, but at dawn
I pack up my things and I'm gone

And I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care, I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
(Said I will not apologize)

I'm imperfect, I'm imperfect
No road map, getting lost on purpose
Phone no service, but it's clear out here
I'm living with nothing to fear out here
There's lessons you learn
Bridges you burn
All for the cost of a dollar to earn
And they say they love me at dusk, but at dawn
I pack up my things and I'm gone

And I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care, I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
(Said I will not apologize)

(But I will not apologize)

I don't know where I'm gonna go
But I don't care, I'm on the road
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize
Been a lot of places in this life
And I did a lot wrong I can't make right
Never been a perfect soul
But I will not apologize

Said I will not apologize
(Yeah, I will not apologize)
 
There's no difference between you and I
We share the same sunshine from the same sky
When it rains, it rains on both you and I
Gotta sink or swim, now it's do or die

It goes hashtag, bodybag
Toe tag
Shot in the chest
Hashtag bodybag
Even when I'm on my last breath

'Til we get reciprocity
How can we stand by?
Yesterday, I turned on the TV
I saw another man down
He was screaming
He can't breathe no more
He held his hands high
But then he got struck down
Oh, he got struck down

I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
Struck down, struck down

There's no difference between you and I
Same space in time that we occupy
We all just looking for a piece of the pie
We went blind, going eye for an eye

It goes hashtag, bodybag
Toe tag
Shot in the chest
Hashtag bodybag
Even when I'm on my last breath

'Til we get reciprocity
How can we stand by?
Yesterday, I turned on the TV
I saw another man down
He was screaming
He can't breathe no more
He held his hands high
But then he got struck down
Oh, he got struck down

I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
I saw the body drop
On the six o'clock
Struck down, struck down

I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
Try to burn me down
Get this whole place lit
I won't give no fucks
I won't take no shit
They said they want war, this is it

Let the body drop
Then let the body drop
Then let the body drop
Then let the body drop
 
Until the philosophy, which holds one race superior
And another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited and abandoned

And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

Everywhere is war
It's a war
Oh, everywhere is war
It's a war

And until there's no longer
First class and second class citizens of any nation
It's on
And until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
We say war

And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
And it's war in the east
War in the west
War up north
And war down south
Everywhere is-
Oh, everywhere is war

(It's war!)
It's a war
(It's war!)
Oh, everywhere is war
(It's war!)
It's a war
Oh, everywhere is war

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
(Everywhere is)
Everywhere is war!

Everywhere is war!
 
There's smoke in the sky again
So I’m gettin' high again
Take another hit to the diaphragm
I never drew the diagram
How to deal with this shit
So I steal and lie again, woah
You're my dream, you’re my nightmare
Life is a bitch, she don't fight fair
Leave you right there
I was hopin' that you'd notice my despair
Run away from the pain, I don't care, 'cause

First they incite the violence
Turn around and then they invite the silence
Burn it down and I think I need some guidance
The kids don't stand a chance
No, the kids don't stand a chance

Old man trouble back again
Fuckin’ up my plans, like oh no, oh no
I’m back to the black again
Gettin' fucked up again, oh no, oh no
Old man trouble back again
Thought I had the upper hand, oh no, oh no
I’m back to the black again
Gettin' fucked up again, oh no, oh no

This cycle is repetitive
Sex, rock 'n' roll, sedatives
Degenerates, need medicine
Spend money for the hell of it
I don’t give a fuck what they sellin' like I'm celibate, no
And I know I'm a piece of shit
Should've learned by now, peace
Need it quick or a piece of it
In school they ain't teachin' it
Each of us tryna find release
But it seems a bit slow

First they incite the violence
Turn around and then they invite the silence
Burn it down, I think I need some guidance
The kids don't stand a chance
No, the kids don't stand a chance (Woo)

Old man trouble back again
Fuckin' up my plans, like oh no, oh no
I'm back to the black again
Gettin' fucked up again, oh no, oh no
Old man trouble back again
Thought I had the upper hand, oh no, oh no
I'm back to the black again
Gettin' fucked up again, oh no, oh no

Now I drink, smoke
Whatever you sellin', I'm a sick joke
My president's a felon, and I can't cope
I'm in love with the pain
So I stick, poke with my kinfolk
Gimme drink, smoke
Whatever you sellin', I'm a sick joke
My president's a felon, and I can't cope
I'm in love with the pain
We takin' on the system 'cause it broke, woo

(Oh no)

Old man trouble back again
Fuckin' up my plans, like oh no, oh no
I'm back to the black again
Gettin' fucked up again, oh no, oh no
Old man trouble back again
Thought I had the upper hand, oh no, oh no
I'm back to the black again
Gettin' fucked up again, oh no, oh no
 
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it, push too far you'll see
The kid has got a dark side
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it’s the last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a dark side
That you don't wanna meet at all, oh-oh

They always picked on him in the class
He would wake up with anxiety attacks
'Til he put a semi-automatic on his back
He got murder in his eyes, uh, yeah
He wore his silence like a mask
Now he’s making up for all the violence in his past
Took it from his father who never bothered to ask
What his son had on his mind

The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it, push too far you'll see
The kid has got a dark side
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it's the last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a dark side
That you don't wanna meet at all
The kid has got a-

The kid has got a dark side
La la la la la

He never went to check under his bed
He was living with the monsters in his head
Sick of getting beat up
He listened, what they said
Told him do some very bad things
And when the time comes that he count to ten
Ain't nobody ever gon' fuck with him again
Feeling all alone, it was him against them
Decided when the lunch bell rings
That he'll sing

The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it, push too far you'll see
The kid has got a dark side
Back against the wall
La la la la la
The kid has got a dark side
Best believe it’s the last trick up his sleeve
The kid has got a dark side
That you don’t wanna meet at all
The kid has got a-

The kid has got a dark side
La la la la la

You can't run, you can’t hide
(The kid has got a-)
You can't run, you can't hide
Someone let me off this ride
(The kid has got a-)
You can't run, you can’t hide
The kid has got a dark side
The kid has got a dark side
The kid has got a dark side
 
I have done bad things, did them to good people
Got no self-control, it's the root of my evil
Wage war in my head when I'm tryna keep it peaceful
A little feels good, a little more and it's lethal
Save me from myself

I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
These bad habits, they die too slow
I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
But if you love me, let me go

I get high to leave all these problems on the ground
Then to my surprise, they're right there when I come back down
I do it like I've done before, a million times
A million and one and I lose my mind
Save me from myself

I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
These bad habits, they die too slow
I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
But if you love me, let me go

But if you love me, let me go

Got pulled by the current 'til I'm runnin' out of breath
Got dragged back down, feel the water in my chest
I've tried getting better, did all of the twelve steps
Who ever would have thought? Who ever could have guessed?
The harder that I chase it, the further that it gets
The harder that I chase it—

I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
These bad habits, they die too slow
I've been caught up in the riptide
For too long 'cause it's all I know
I've been lettin' this shit slide
But if you love me, let me go

Let me go
But if you love me, let me go
 
Tell me, how did we get here?
And where the fuck do we go now?
First I was floating through the atmosphere
But now I'm looking up at rock bottom, bottom
(Bottom, bottom)

Everybody told me ever since I was young
I should bite my tongue
Couple kids, picket fence, maybe earn a nice income
It'll get you some
Peace of mind, step in line, everything'll be just fine
Then I looked up, found they must've left me behind
Sent shivers down my spine

Tell me, how did we get here?
And where the fuck do we go now?
First I was floating through the atmosphere
But now I'm looking up at rock bottom, bottom
(Bottom, bottom)

My next-door neighbor said I better get a 9 to 5
Just to stay alive
Talkin' 'bout change, boy, that's nothin' but a waste of time
Now I, now I wish that I
Read the signs better 'cause the writing was on the wall
And now we got front row seats, watch the system fall
'Cause look who's in control

Tell me, how did we get here?
And where the fuck do we go now?
First I was floating through the atmosphere
But now I'm looking up at rock bottom, bottom
(Bottom, bottom)

Dam-dam, badada-dam, badada-bam-bam, badada-bam-bam
Badada-dam, badada-dam, badada-bam-bam, badada-bam-bam
Badada-dam, badada-dam, badada-bam-bam, badada-bam-bam
Badada-dam, badada-dam, la-la la la la la la la la
Badada-dam, badada-dam, badada-bam-bam, badada-bam-bam
Badada-dam, badada-dam, la-la la la la la la la la
Badada-dam, badada-dam, badada-bam-bam, badada-bam-bam
Badada-dam, badada-dam
('Cause look who's in control-trol)
'Cause look who's in control

Tell me, how did we get here?
And where the fuck do we go now?
First I was floating through the atmosphere
But now I'm looking up at rock bottom, bottom
Tell me, how did we get here?
And where the fuck do we go now?
First I was floating through the atmosphere
But now I'm looking up at rock bottom, bottom
(Bottom, bottom)
 
I got my bags packed and I'm ready to go
Tell me one damn thing I ain't already know
Got my bags packed and I'm ready to run
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang
Saw a gun
Someone hits the floor
She tell me, "Better step back from that open door"
Got my bags packed, can't take no more
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang

My lady caught me, yeah she caught me
Yeah she caught me with another woman in my bed
She got the gun out of the closet
Yeah she cocked it and she put the barrel to my head
She said, "You told me that you loved me last night
I should've known that you would never act right
Oh, lord, give me a reason to believe in you
And tell me why I shouldn't go and end your life"

I got my bags packed and I'm ready to go
Tell me one damn thing I ain't already know
Got my bags packed and I'm ready to run
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang

Saw a gun, someone hits the floor
She tell me, "Better step back from that open door"
Got my bags packed, can't take no more
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang

I tried to tell her, tried to tell her
Tried to tell her she's the only woman in my plans
But then my side chick started getting violent
And tried to pull the piece from her hand
The shot was loud and then the flash so bright
That I was blinded nearly lost my sight
Oh, lord, couldn't do nothing, nah, I never saw it coming
Hit the ground running for my life

Oh, I got my bags packed and I'm ready to go
Tell me one damn thing I ain't already know
I got my bags packed and I'm ready to run
Mmm, but then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang

But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang
No, I never meant to hurt nobody
No, I never meant to hurt nobody
No, I never meant to hurt nobody
No
But then she pulled me back in with a kiss, bang
 
How do you get in the mind-state to kill?
How do you get in the mind-state to kill?
I need a fill
Of violence to bust up the silence for real
Traumatized, ain't gonna hide how I feel
The truth is alive and well
It’s underground living on the Wi-Fi still
Don't buy all the lies they sell
When the Black Hawk flies head right for the hills

They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
Woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
You decide if you wanna ride, can't stop us when we unified
I woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
Stigmata!
(Stigmata)

There ain’t no hero to save the day
Figure to pave the way quicker
To stave another day
Away before we gotta pay the gravedigger
It's all up to us to deliver
I walk through the valley where the snakes, they slither
Where the rain gets thicker and the pain disfigures
Who's gonna rise when saints pray to sinners?
The truth won't die when they pull that trigger

They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
Woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
You decide if you wanna ride, can't stop us when we unified
I woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
Stigmata!
(Stigmata)

Burn me down, strip me bare
Watch me drown, I don't care
Drag your nails across my mind
Still I walk, sanctified
(The truth won't die when they pull that trigger!)
(Stigmata)
(The truth won't die when they pull that trigger!)

They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
I woke up with these holes in my hands from the day I was crucified
You decide if you wanna ride, can’t stop us when we unified
They put a hole in the back of my head, called it suicide
Stigmata!
 
Tell me what I'm supposed to think‬
When the bullets start to pour
Lie about some greater good‬
When you ship me off to war‬
A thousand dead on either side
Is there no one keeping score‬?
I just wanna make it home
When you ship me off to war

We at war, we don't know what for
They made up a reason behind closed doors
At the end of the season, we leave
Make an enemy bleed, hit the sеashore with the C4
We don't rеcord, we just reload
If you need more, it's a cheat code with unlimited rounds
When you hear the sound, start hitting the ground
It's time to go make America proud
But this ain't as fun as what they claim it be
This ain't a video game, you see
I shot the kid same age as me
'Cause he ain't from the same place as me
And now the bloodstain stays with me
I'm homesick and I miss my mama
Can't sleep, I'm living with this trauma
I wanna just believe the dogma
But I can't take it much longer

Tell me what I'm supposed to think‬
When the bullets start to pour
Lie about some greater good‬
When you ship me off to war‬
A thousand dead on either side
Is there no one keeping score‬?
I just wanna make it home
When you ship me off to war

When you ship me off to war

Yeah
Watch me spend these billions
Bombing these civilians
Making enemies out of children
Am I the good guy? Am I the villain?
I go back and forth, chameleon
My partner next to me, he was twenty-three
When he went out to check the scene
Then he stepped on an IED, goddamn
Teflon, got a bulletproof vest on
But I still wanna hide and flee
Something died inside when I wondered
Why they caught him and not me
This shit ain't always what it seem
When they changing the regime
Better wake me from this crazy dream
Living in the war machine

Tell me what I'm supposed to think‬
When the bullets start to pour
Lie about some greater good‬
When you ship me off to war‬
A thousand dead on either side
Is there no one keeping score‬?
I just wanna make it home
When you ship me off to war

Ship me off to war
Ship me off to war
Ship me off to war
Ship me off to war

Joined Uncle Sam as soon as I turned eighteen (Oh no, no, no)
Try to wash my hands, never gonna get them clean (Oh no, no, no)
Follow my command, do or die, ain't no in between (Oh no, no, no)
Try to wash my hands, never gonna get them clean
(PTSD, PTSD)
I might, I might
Fuck around and start World War III
(Woo)

Tell me what I'm supposed to think‬
When the bullets start to pour
Lie about some greater good‬
When you ship me off to war‬
A thousand dead on either side
Is there no one keeping score‬?
I just wanna make it home
When you ship me off to war
 
The sun ablaze as Maria's foot touches the sand
On northern land, as human contraband
She got her name passed down to the Boss
Now she’s stuck on a truckbed, clutching her cross
Yanqui guns, blood debts on the loans
Smoldering fields with rape, rubble, and bones
Graves hidden, trapped in visions of war
She prays to nothing, no one, nobody no more

Tear away at the mask
Oh, tear away at the mask

And now she's got a quota, the needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across the new line of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim, the point an inch from her vein
The foreman approaches, his steps pound in her brain
His steps pound in her brain
Her arms jerks, the sisters gather ’round her and scream
As if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit blood to the floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody no more

Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Ooh, tear away at the mask

No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
It eclipses her day
Just a moment to pray
Just a moment to pray
No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
No moment to pray
No minute to rest
It eclipses her day
Just a moment to pray
Just a moment to pray

Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
Tear away at the mask
