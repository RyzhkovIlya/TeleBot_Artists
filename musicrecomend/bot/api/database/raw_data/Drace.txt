Intro:
Yeah!
Drace!
Ay, I'ma bout to get bigger
Yeah
Drace!
Verse:
I never cook a food with a microwave
She suckin' on my dick, she needs some accolades
My grandma is the man of the house
Haters in the streets runnin' like a mouse
I started from the bottom but I wasn't never shallow
Started writin' lyrics up, there was nobody to follow
I've been In the kitchen cookin' up my lyrics
I better serve my fans cos I see they hungry
I be hating all these niggas talkin' bout' my situation, every time they preachin' on my name like the holy gospel
I got these ladies trippin' for my accent
And these niggas hate me cos I'm different
I be cutting niggas off, but I got no scissors
Bitch I'm tryna walk on water like I'm Jesus
Ima man every time I'm looking at the mirrors
Got a Lamborghini, Maserati with a Lexus
Huh! Ho!
Levate
Her booty breakin' down, that's an ass quake
I got houses on that ass like an ass-state
Got some hunnids in the bank like a cash state
I gat triple x down, that's a sad thing
Never fuck a broke bitch with a g-string
Ni tori pe mi o fine, she told her friends I was fugly
Mo ti lowo sin, she comin' back acting like she know me
I've been so religious,prayin' for my homies nigga
Never double me, it's a crucifixion
I was Flipping through the pages like the holy bible
I be gettin' so wild, walkin' in the jungle
I no dey try to form, nigga, get informed
She said I drive her crazy, I never took a turn
My strings are blingin", drippin' with the ice
I'm playin' twin deuces with the dice
Nigga!
Outro:
Lyrical Summer!
Ima bout to get bigger
Cos now i gone bigger and
Bigger and bigger
Yah!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
