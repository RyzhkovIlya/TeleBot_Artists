If you want me to listen whisper
If you want me to run just walk
Wrap your name in lace and leather
I can hear you
You don't need to talk
Let us make a thousand mistakes
Cause we will never learn
You're my obsession
My fetish, my religion
My confusion, my confession
The one I want tonight
You're my obsession
The question and conclusion
You are, you are, you are
My fetish you are
You can kiss me with your torture
Tie me up to golden chains
Leave me beggin undercover
Wrong or right
It's all role play
Let us make a thousand mistakes
We'll never learn
You're my obsession
My fetish, my religion
My confusion, my confession
The one I want tonight
You're my obsession
The question and conclusion
You are, you are, you are
My fetish you are
Uhhhhhhuhhhhh
Come to me
Uhhhhhhuhhhhh
Tonight
You're my obsession
My fetish, my religion
My confusion, my confession
The one I want tonight
You're my obsession
The question and conclusion
You are, you are, you are
My fetish you are

The curtain's closed
No way home
The nectar of life run dry
These tainted words
Made to hurt
Cut in me with its' knife
Eating my mind
And with each bite
I'm begging Please Lord, no
This place is a mess
The one has gone
Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now
Trained to attack
Bull eye shot in black
I never thought they'd get me
These pictures in my head...
Lying in my bed...
These whips make me bleed
This place is a mess
My one has gone
Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right now
I can't hear the sceneries
Of constant tragedies
Of what I meant to feel no more
Cause I'm already dead
And I just cannot bear
To hear another word no more
Lovesongs, they kill me
They kill me... Now
Lovesongs are killing me
Are killing me... Right nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
 
I don´t believe in miracles
I never did
Nothing ever happens here
So sick of it
I-I-I told you
I-I-I need to
Get-get myself into something new
I´m for something mystical, hysterical
Dark, intensive, sexual
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(E-e-e-ever, e-e-e-ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
Forever or never
I don´t believe in fairytales
Too cynical
Everybody stop and stare
I let it go
I-I-I told you
I-I-I need to
Stick-stick-stick out
Just can't be like you
Send myself to outer space
A better place
Gotta win the human race
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(E-e-e-ever, e-e-e-ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never
Forever or never
For my love
For my love
For my love, it's forever, forever
For my love
For my love
For my love, it's forever, forever
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Better make it now or never
(E-e-e-ever, e-e-e-ever)
I'm not gonna live forever
Said I'm not gonna live forever
Gotta make it now or never

I'm a punk, I'm a sinner
I'm a lost new beginner
I'm a thread to myself
I'm a get armargeddon
I'm a freak, I'm a liar
I'm a flirt, I deny that I know it
Then I mess it up
And sometimes I feel like
I'm only one
No wonder why I've become
So dum so dum di dum di dum
I get more and more strange
I'm going insane I'm building it up
Just to break it down
You get what you see
The product of a dysfunctional family
Dysfunction, dysfunctional
Dysfunctional family
Dysfunction, dysfunctional
Dysfunctional family
I'm a bit suicidal
I'm my own worst rival
Trainwreck, white trash, freak, maniac, psycho
I'm a troublemaking rebel
Made a deal with the devil
I'm way past ever coming back
But sometimes I feel like
I'm not the only one
When I see why I've become
So dum so dum di dum di dum

I was betrayed
There is no fate
An open sore
I'm in too deep
I can't believe
Anymore
Will you take what's left of me
Reanimate my trust in fate
Angel in disguise
(You save my soul)
But you make my heart go blind
My devils rage inside
(Just can't let go)
'Cause it feels so right
You make my heart go blind
The city sleeps
In empty streets
No gleam of hope
(Godforsaken)
There's no escape
I'm so afraid
Of being cold
Just to cope with society
Reanimate my trust in fate
Angel in disguise
(You save my soul)
But you make my heart go blind
My devils rage inside
(Just can't let go)
'Cause it feels so right
You make my heart go blind
You save my soul
You make my heart go blind
There is no fate
We've been betrayed
Can you ease my mind
I'm blind with rage
Reanimate my trust in fate
Search deep down inside
And heal the pain
Angel in disguise
(You save my soul)
But you make my heart go blind
My devils rage inside
(Just can't let go)
'Cause it feels so right
You make my heart go blind
Angel in disguise
(You save my soul)
But you make my heart go blind

I'm sick and tired of this so-called life
Without room to breathe
I toss and turn in my bed all night
Am I the only one who finds no peace
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Escape to the stars
Feeling so free
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe
Escape to the stars
(To the stars)
I've always been the one to speak my mind
Strove against the stream
Take on the system or leave it behind
And you will find a new reality
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
Escape to the stars
Feeling so free
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
(To the stars)
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe
Escape to the stars
(To the stars)
A new reality
Overcome gravity
Holding you down
On the ground
Free from insanity
No one else is around
Escape to the stars
Feeling so free
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe
Escape to the stars
(To the stars)
Feeling so free
(So free)
Just you and me
Escape to the stars
(To the stars)
Chasing a dream
All that we need is to believe

You haven't got to say
What you think you need to say
I already know
You played a part in a stupid show
Now you're wondering
How I'm wandering
Through the maze
Between the heartaches
Crashing and burning
This turns out surreal
Crashing and turning
You know that I feel
You're chances are over
The curtain is down
The lights are out
Stop all your acting now
For this performance I take a bow
You, you could have had it all
Now you are playin' a fallen star
And you're wondering
How I'm wandering
Through the maze
Between the heartaches
Crashing and burning
This turns out surreal
Crashing and turning
You know that I feel
You're chances are over
The curtain is down
The lights are out
Stop the masquerade
There's no one left
Just you and me
Just empty seats
Don't say your lines
Say what you feel
There is no script
This show is real
Or if you can't
I have to leave the stage behind
And say goodbye
I say goodbye
The show is over
Crashing and burning
This turns out surreal
The show is over
Crashing and turning
You know that I feel
The show is over
Over, over, over, over
And over, and over
Crashing and burning
This turns out surreal

You know that I feel
You could have had me

Why - why should we go deeper into this
I don't know
Try - I'm tryin' to find what's in your secret
I don't know
Time - the minutes are counted between us

We all have our secrets
They're better left unsaid
We all have our issues
That we want to forget
I was getting kicks
Out of my box of tricks
I was playing with her mind
Planting bombs to get inside
But now my favorite toy has left
And she said
There's no regrets
Why's love and hate
Always a step ahead
What's left
Caught in betrayal
We failed
Je ne regrette rien
We failed
We failed
We failed
Je ne regrette rien
It was all so cosy
Her world of lillipinks
Rubbing all my glitter
On my litter to sink in
Washing with the paste
She used for the glaze
I was cutting up her
Edges with disgrace
But now my favorite toy has left
And she said
There's no regrets
Why's love and hate
Always a step ahead
What's left
Caught in betrayal
We failed
Je ne regrette rien
There's no regrets
Why's love and hate
Always a step ahead
What's left
Caught in betrayal
We failed
Je ne regrette rien
I am Jekyll when I'm Hyde
I'm a demon locked inside
I am restless when I sleep
I'm the beauty and the beast
She knew me
Yet she said
There's no regrets
Why's love and hate
Always a step ahead
What's left
Caught in betrayal
We failed
Je ne regrette rien
We failed

God is dead
When someone fills your heart instead
Your soul's on fire
All your needs
How can they call it blasphemy
Love is nature
So you're praying for salvation
For their hearts to understand
That it's you...
My new religion is you...
They say this love is blasphemy
It is blasphemy
It is blasphemy
But my new religion is you...
Faith is crime
When all you love is on the line
Your spirit's bleeding
Incomplete
And blamed for immorality
Love is nature
So you're breaking with tradition
In this God forsaken land
That it's you...
My new religion is you...
They say this love is blasphemy
It is blasphemy
It is blasphemy
But my new religion is you...
That it's you...
(Blasphemy)
(God is dead)

Lookin' for a shot of you
In someone else's smile
I'm holdin' on to every word
Comparin' all the time
The more I break the more they talk
I'm left paralyzed
I'm struggling through the lonely nights
Questions fill my mind
I'm touching and kissing
With tears in my eyes
No one can help me forget
You're touching and kissing
With tears in your eyes
It's not over
Running through these dirty streets
Of concrete and steel
Wrapped up in these velvet sheets
Give me something surreal
There's no substitute
No one else is you
No one else is you
I'm fallin' into someone's eyes
Come make me feel alive
I'm touching and kissing
With tears in my eyes
No one can help me forget
You're touching and kissing
With tears in your eyes
And no it's just not over yet
This tunnel just goes on and on and on
Repeating - Repeating - Repeating
Can someone just let me out
It keeps - It keeps repeating - repeating
All the time - time - time
Time - time - time - time
Time - time - time - time
I'm touching and kissing
With tears in my eyes
No one can help me forget
You're touching and kissing

Do you erase
What you're thinking
And replace
What you feel
Do you know how it hurts
When you lose a friend
You waste your time with anger
Waste your life with fear
Do you know what it means
When the story ends
You simply can't help hiding
You can't say what you feel
Do you erase and replace
What you're thinking
Do you erase and replace
What you feel
There're so many ways to get lost
When love lies bleeding
Erase and replace
Now what is real
It's so hard to forget
When you simply can't
You need something to believe in
But you can not turn back time
It is true that you win
Even if you lose
The things that really matter
They're always on your mind
Do you erase and replace
What you're thinking
Do you erase and replace
What you feel
There're so many ways to get lost
When love lies bleeding
Erase and replace
Now what is real
You keep looking for something
That's been in front of your face
Do you erase and replace
What is missing
Erase and replace
'Til it's here
Do you erase and replace
What you're thinking
Do you erase and replace
What you feel
There're so many ways to get lost
When love lies bleeding

Bittersweet memories
Of a love we had before
Blinded by sanity
What's behind the crimson door
What happened to my eyes
Incapable of seeing signs
There's just one miracle
That's left of this love
After the rain
I still see heaven crying
After the rain
I still feel no relief
'Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel
It all becomes so frightening real
After the rain
Rainbow skies turned to grey
Ever since we lost our smile
Innocence gone astray
Since the day we said goodbye
What happened to our dreams
Aborted in this dried out stream
There's just one miracle
That's left of this love
After the rain
I still see heaven crying
After the rain
I still feel no relief
'Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel
It all becomes so frightening real

I was walking in the shadows
So nobody cared
You smiled at me from the distance
And without the smallest chance
And we felt there's more to share
All these memories
They come back
When I´m asleep
You´ve taken my dreams
I don´t need no fakes around me
All I want is you to be with me
Here I am
All these words have lost their meaning
I just hope you hear my silent scream
I still hear the distant voices
Spreading rumours and lies
I took you to my darkest places
So far from the skies
I would charm you
We made vows
To not let go
But where are you now?
I don't need no fakes around me
All I want is you to be with me
Here I am
All these words have lost their meaning
I just hope you hear my silent scream
I'm so numb
Can't you hear me?
Here I am
(My silent scream)
There is something
Inside me
That still wants to feel

I don't need no fakes around me

Once upon a time
There was love in your eyes
That was 49 days ago
You knew I'd understand
Said you're goin' for a dance
But you never came back home
I was sittin' by the phone
Thinking when you're gonna call
But you left me
You left me on my own
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know if you got laid (aha aha)
I don't wanna know if you got laid (aha aha)
I don't wanna know if you're all right
'Cause when I said I missed you I lied
I don't wanna know if you got laid
Stop the tape and replay
Standing in the club
I could see that you got up
Holding hands with what's-his-name
And a voice from the right
Said you've seen him for a while
Got the story on my Plate
I wanna go outside
Need some air and some time
A million pictures
Pictures that rotate
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know if you got laid (aha aha)
I don't wanna know if you got laid (aha aha)
I don't wanna know if you're all right
'Cause when I said I missed you I lied
I don't wanna know if you got laid

So I run - run - run - run away
I run - run - run - run away
I run - run - run - run away
I run - don't wanna hear no more

Imagination baby can take you far
Don't be afraid to come off slightly bizarre
It can be scary baby ghostly I am
I'm coming through like I'm the
Lost son of sam
Lost son of sam
There's nothing safer baby that is a fact
Turn into something go put on something black
But don't you worry
Cause you'll never get hurt
And everybody feeling
Sexy say yeah
Sexy say yeah
When you're feeling kind of gorgeous
Call me on the phone and get off
Get off
When time is kinda precious
I can come undone and get off
Get off
Yeah
Russian champagne in the back of the car
You can be the bubbles I'll be your Dracula
I've got a million other tricks up my sleeve
Go get you're jacket babe
Get ready to leave
Get ready to leave
If you don't wanna go feel free to sit tight
Two talkaholics we can do it all night
But if you're longing for some real human touch
I'm coming over just like
I am too much
I am too much
When you're feeling kind of gorgeous
Call me on the phone and get off
Get off
When time is kinda precious
I can come undone and get off
Get off
Yeah
When you're feeling kind of gorgeous
Call me on the phone and get off
Get off
When time is kinda precious
I can come undone and get off
Get off
When you're feeling kind of gorgeous
Call me on the phone and get off
Get off
When time is kinda precious
I can come undone and get off
Get off
